I was on the train into work the other day, and it was standing room only. 

I love people-watching on my commute. I was looking around at all the faces tilted town towards 
phone screens, eyes scanning. 

I hoped they were boppinâ€™ to Prince too. But more than likely, they were 
catching up, and quickly. On Facebook. On memes. On news sound bites and on email. With limited 
real estate and time, marketers need to stick out and make audiences pause.
