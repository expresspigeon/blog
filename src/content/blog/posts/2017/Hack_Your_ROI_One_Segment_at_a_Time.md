## Hack Your ROI One Segment at a Time...


Any experienced email marketer knows that delivering a relevant message to an interested person at the 
right time is the key to success. If you’re not segmenting your lists, you are basically 
_putting a square peg into a round hole_. In order to target customer segments you need to have 
viable data that differentiates individuals from one another.

## Track your customers!

Let’s say you are an online fashion retailer who had a sale last month on black and gold high-heel shoes and this 
month you just received a shipment of matching gold handbags. 

It makes sense to target the individuals who purchased the shoes, as they are likely to want the matching handbag!
 
Simply creating a segment of shoe buyers and sending them a message focused on the bag is going to drive 
them to buy that handbag!

## Know your audience

I recently encountered an event promoter trying to sell tickets for a music festival featuring various 
artists across several genres of music. Instead of sending a second promotional email to the entire audience, 
they could segment their data and send out targeted emails that focus on specific genres as indicated by the 
recipients during sign up.

The success of email marketing is entirely dependent on using segments to find your target market. 

 > Segment, and  you will deliver the right message to the right person at the right time!
