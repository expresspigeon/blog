It's really amazing to be one of the many fast growing, globally relevant companies blasting out of 
the Chicago tech scene. All of us, making our digital footprint on the entire world while leaving our 
logo on the ever relevant G2 Crowd grid for a world of potential clients to see.

The Grid, which holds all of us to the highest of standards by leaving our reputations in the hands 
of the very clients we serve, has continued to keep us focused on the needs of our users and their ongoing 
satisfaction with the products and services we provide.

We cannot possibly convey enough gratitude to our Chicago peers and global clients for their part in 
placing us so deeply into the "High Performers" quadrant of the new 
[Summer 2017 Chicago Gridscape](http://go.g2crowd.com/citygrid_Chicago.html) that G2 Crowd 
just released. 

We will continue to do what it takes to remain among the top contenders in our industry, 
and look forward to continued feedback from our users to fuel our progression in the grid. Thank you!
