Tracking new subscriptions is a tried and true, tell tale way to monitor the success of your marketing campaigns. 
If gauging the efficacy of your marketing spend and knowing which strategies are driving the most new subscribers to your list is
important to you, then it’s absolutely important to set up Google Analytics. The process of setting this up is incredibly simple 
and the best part is that if done correctly you’re also creating a double opt-in process that will improve the quality of new submissions
by eliminating [SPAM traps](https://expresspigeon.com/blog/2016/09/29/make-sure-your-emails-are-getting-through).

that you’re only tracking engaged subscribers that are completing all steps of the double opt-in process.
