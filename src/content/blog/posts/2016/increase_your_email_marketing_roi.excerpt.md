For the past two years, we've been talking about the importance of personalization in your marketing techniques. 

The  question remains, why isn't everyone onboard?

Marketing is always changing and adjusting so it is important to stay informed about the trends. 
Personalization has become extremely important in marketing. Weather that means making sure you are addressing 
your prospects by name or customizing your email messages/content to touch each individual personâ€™s needs. 
There are so many opportunities to personalize your marketing but I think it overwhelms some marketers and that 
is why not everyone is focusing on it, even after discussing it for over 2 years.
