G2Crowd Awards ExpressPigeon in Email Marketing: Best of Breed Category
ExpressPigeon gets High Performer recognition again by [G2Crowd's](http://www.g2crowd.com/)  
The Grid℠,  which is a proprietary software recommendation engine. This award is given for products 
that are rated highly by their users but have not yet achieved the market share and 
scale of the vendors in the Leader category.

The Grid℠ represents the democratic voice of real software users, rather than the 
opinion of just one analyst. G2Crowd rates email marketing: best of breed products 
algorithmically based on data sourced from reviews shared by G2Crowd users and data 
aggregated from online sources and social networks. These products are ranked as 
either a Leader, High Performer, Contender, and Niche.

Contenders have significant market presence and resources, but their products have 
received below average user satisfaction ratings or have not received a sufficient 
number of reviews to validate their products.

Niche products do not have the market presence of the Leaders. 
They may have been rated positively on customer satisfaction, but have not received 
enough reviews to validate their success.

"G2Crowd's recent email marketing report features ExpressPigeon as a high performer on the Grid," 
said Marty Duffy, director of research for [G2Crowd's](http://www.g2crowd.com/). "**97%** of users rate their level 
of satisfaction with ExpressPigeon at four or five stars. Most users pointed out the 
product’s usability and intuitive interface as significant highlights."
