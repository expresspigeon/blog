Email marketing, unlike other functions, makes mistakes virtually impossible to hide.
When you send an email, any error made is seen by every customer that opens the emails.
As email marketers, it is important to follow a checklist that ensures the final draft is free from all errors and that
everything you wanted to include is included. The following tips will help to ensure that you are sending an error-free
email each and every time.



## Subject Line

The subject line is one of the most important aspects of a marketing email. It should be catchy and draw people
in without being confusing or giving away the main information about the product or service you are promoting.
Most importantly, the subject line must encourage the reader to be curious enough to open the email. It is very
important that you read the subject line several times to ensure it makes sense. It is sometimes helpful to send
the email to a coworker or a friend to get their thoughts on the subject line.

## Compelling Content

Although an email isn't expected to be as professional and perfect as the content on your website, it still
represents your company. Poor content can have a few different outcomes. For example, it may prevent visitors
from going to the website or it may prevent them from opening any future emails from your company. In the worst case
scenario, emails with poor content will cast a doubt on your company and not only encourage people to unsubscribe,
but give you a bad review as well. So, it is critical that you read and reread all content. Again, make sure it is
free from spelling and grammar errors and that the content makes sense.

## Subscribe/Unsubscribe

As important as it is to make it easy to subscribe to your company, it should also be easy to unsubscribe. Even
the best marketing campaigns will have audiences that are simply not interested in the campaign, so make it easy to
opt out and unsubscribe. You should also follow through with a pleasant response, which will help you maintain
your good standing with customers who are still likely to use your service/product in the future.

## Sent From...

In some situations, a funny or unique name for your newsletter can appear as spam to your subscribers.
So, make sure to only use the name that is associated with your company as the sender and/or as the title of
the newsletter. If you want to use a fun new name, try to only use it within the email itself and be sure to
still include your company name to reflect who you are, such as in the closing.

## Links

There is nothing more frustrating for a customer who took the time to read your email, only to end up with a
broken or dead link. It is important to try them out one-by-one to ensure each works and that it goes to the page
you intended. Also keep in mind that opening an email that has a link included in each line is a distraction as
well as a turn-off to many customers, so limit the links to no more than three and make sure they lead to pages
that are relevant to the email.

## Review

After completing the email draft, set it aside for a little bit and go back to read it later. This will give you
a chance to read the email with a fresh new outlook on the content. Read it thoroughly and if possible send it to
a coworker or friend to read as well. If any part of the email does not make sense to you, it won't make sense
to your customers. Your marketing emails are an opportunity to promote new traffic to your website and encourage
continued visits from current customers, so you should draft them as though you are addressing an audience that
has gathered together just to hear you speak.
