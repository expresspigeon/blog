Is your marketer's head spinning around, trying to shove data from one app to another? 
 While you can integrate with apps APIs you're not really a developer. 

You've never heard of [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) if you've been under a rock for the past few years. 
If so, [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is an Internet connector which allows you to tie your data from various Internet apps.
Let's say you have an account with [SalesForce](https://www.salesforce.com/) and with us. 
How long will it take you to send a triggered email to a contact on a new opportunity? One option is to hire a developer to do the job, and 
maybe in a week or two, you'll have your integration. Another, better option, is to use 
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) which will only take a few clicks.


## Some examples
 
**Shopify**: Say you are running a webstore on [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and want to send 
a triggered message to a customer who has abandoned their shopping cart. Simply connect your [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) 
and ExpressPigeon account via Zapier and select a proper trigger. You customer will receive an email 
reminding them to complete their purchase.

**SalesForce**: When working with SalesForce you often have to update customer data. Wouldn't it be nice to
keep that pesky customer data updated and ready to go in your ExpressPigeon account? Once you connect your 
  SalesForce and your ExpressPigeon accounts via Zapier and select the right trigger and action to update your 
  customer data, it will be left to Zapier's magic to keep your contacts up to date.
