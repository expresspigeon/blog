Once you've decided to integrate email marketing into your overall advertising campaign, you certainly want to get your
money's worth. While it's tempting to buy email lists to supplement the list you're generating from your opt-in
collection efforts, bear in mind that doing so may blow your deliverability rates all to smithereens, making future
campaigns more difficult. Success in delivering email content is no guarantee that your emails will land in your
recipients' inbox. Why? What's the difference between delivery and deliverability and why should you care all that much? 

## Delivery versus Deliverability

Delivery = your email finding its way from your mailing service to a recipient's email provider. From there, it can be
headed off at the pass and blocked, sent automatically to the spam folder or sent to the inbox, which you earnestly desire.
Deliverability = dodging the automated or user-directed gauntlet and making a solid landing in the inbox where,
you hope, your recipient will be delighted to see it. 

## Spam Kills Reputations Even if You Didn't Mean to Do It

In an effort to provide a great user experience, most of the major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) — Google, Yahoo!, 
etc. — now track where their subscriber's emails come from and what actions befall them once the user receives them.
Using clever algorithms and spam traps, ISPs can determine whether your recipient really, personally and with deliberate
forethought opted into your email list or if you're a known serial spammer.

A spam trap is an email address that is monitored but never used, which is to say, emails are never sent from it
and there is no live person managing it, therefore it can't have ever opted in to your list. So, if it receives mail
from you, you'll be flagged as a definite spammer and possibly blocked from successful delivery to your receiver's
inbox and this ISP altogether. When you've cultivated an email following, your recipients already expressed their
desire to hear from you, and you want to move heaven and earth to fulfill that yearning. The best way to realize that
mutually-beneficial goal is to never be labeled as a spammer by any ISPs.

## Put Your Best Foot Forward from the Beginning

Back to those [purchased lists](https://expresspigeon.com/blog/2014/02/12/11-reasons-to-never-purchase-an-email-list).
You may get plentiful deliveries off these lists, but odds are some of those email
addresses will be spam traps. Those emails that are sent to a spam trap will smear your domain, IP addresses, return
address and sender name with a thick layer of suspicion. Additionally, since theoretically, none of those outside
addresses ever opted in to your invitation, many, if not most, will be tossed in the user's spam folder. The ISP is
quite likely to notice this activity and flag your domain, IP addresses, return address and sender name as spam. 

While it's possible, but not easy or quick, to extricate your domain from this quagmire, why create it in the first
place? You should launch your email marketing campaign properly from the outset by avoiding dirty lists and using only
those addresses [acquired legitimately](https://expresspigeon.com/blog/2014/02/24/16-opt-in-tricks-to-grow-your-email-list).
As you enjoy increased revenues from your email marketing and your list grows,
be sure to [prune out addresses](https://expresspigeon.com/blog/2014/05/05/7-overlooked-ways-to-jump-start-your-email-list-today) 
that no longer open your messages so the ISPs never have to peer at your domain with a
cocked eyebrow.

Email marketing is a fabulous way to reach and engage people who already want to do business with you. But it can seem
like an overwhelming proposition. You're going to need an education in the finer points and may well need help in
generating your list, developing content, putting it out on a regular basis and analyzing the results.
