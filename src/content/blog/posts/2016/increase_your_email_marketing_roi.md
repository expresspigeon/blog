For the past two years, we've been talking about the **importance of personalization** in your marketing techniques. 
The question remains, why isn't everyone onboard?

Marketing is always changing and adjusting so it is important to stay informed about the trends. **Personalization** has 
become extremely important in marketing. Weather that means making sure you are addressing your prospects by name or 
customizing your email messages/content to touch each individual person’s needs. There are so many opportunities to 
**personalize your marketing** but I think it overwhelms some marketers and that is why not everyone is focusing on it, 
even after discussing it for over 2 years.
 
An easy way to start your personalization marketing strategy is within your email marketing campaigns. 
[Email Marketing Service Providers](http://expresspigeon.com) have features to allow you to personalize your messages to your readers. 
For instance we have powerful capabilities to personalize your message as much or as 
little as you would like.
 
A study conducted by 
[Experian Marketing Services](http://marketingland.com/study-70-brands-personalizing-emails-missing-higher-transaction-rates-revenue-73241) 
showed that _personalized promotional mailings had a **29% higher unique open rate and 41% higher unique click rate**, which resulted in increasing transaction rates and revenue._
_For triggered email campaigns, personalization resulted in double the transaction rates compared to non-personalized triggered emails_.

[Clickz.com stated](https://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2374653/the-importance-of-personalization), 
“We’ve learned a lot about personalization this year. We know that personalized 
emails can produce transaction rates and revenue 6 times higher than non-personalized messages.”

We have all heard the term “Internet of Things” by now but have you heard of "Internet of Me"? [Verndale](http://www.verndale.com/) (A marketing technology agency) 
discusses how it has and is changing marketing in 
[their blog](http://www.verndale.com/insights/blog/2015/october/the-internet-of-me-why-personalization-is-more-important-than-ever/). 
Within their blog they give stats about personalization 
marketing that shouldn’t surprise anyone. 

*Almost three-fourths (74%) of online consumers get frustrated with websites when content is not personalized/related to their interests. - Janrain & Harris* 

*Interactive Personalized calls-to-action result in a 42% higher conversion rate than calls-to-action that are the same for all visitors. - Hubspot* 

*Organizations who are personalizing their web experiences see, on average, a 19% uplift in sales. - Monetate* 

*Leads who are nurtured with targeted content produce a 20% increase in sales opportunities. -DemandGen*

*Forty percent (40%) of consumers buy more from retailers who personalize the shopping experience across channels. – MyBuys*
 
*In 2018, B2B companies who personalize their sites will be doing 30% better than those without personalization. – Gartner*
 
*Sixty-four percent (64%) of people say the customer experience is more important than price in their choice of brand. – Gartner*

The importance of personalization in [email marketing has](http://expresspigeon.com) continued to grow from consumers becoming accustomed to seeing 
customized content. Personalization is a best practice for marketers since it is the only way to truly grab a customer's 
attention. So to ask the same question I started this conversation with: why isn't everyone doing it? What do you think 
the reason is?
