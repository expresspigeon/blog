the subscriber must fill these fields out in order to receive your
newsletters. With Express Pigeon you can collect the following details:

​4) End their registration with a "Big Thank You" by filling out the
"After Submit" tab

Under the Form Submit Feedback Page, make sure to fill in the message
area with a "Big Thanks." Then give them further instructions on what
their next step is, like checking their email for further information.
When they open their email, they will have a double opt-in email to make
sure they want to subscribe to your company&apos;s newsletter. After they
confirm the subscription, we&apos;d like to say, "Congrats on a brand new
potential customer!"

be redirected to the information you provide on this tab. Choose between
having them redirected to a display page or a URL. Give the confirmation
page a title, and then add an additional note of thanks and a
confirmation that they have been added to the newsletter list.

corner, copy this URL and place it on your website in the content. When
your customers click this link they will be redirected to our website
