In the previous article [SPF in plain English](spf-in-plain-english-and-a-few-internet-terms),
I explained SPF. In
this post, I&apos;ll discuss DKIM. Since this is a fairly involved computer
process, I have to prepare you by explaining [Public Cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and
[Digital Signatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature). Don&apos;t be scared, this is just a logical
explanation and there is no math involved (refer to the title). :)
