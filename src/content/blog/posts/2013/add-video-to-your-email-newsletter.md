Adding video to your email newsletter is one of the best ways to excite,
inspire, and engage your subscribers. We all love a good video!
Unfortunately, it&apos;s not possible to reliably embed a playable video into
a newsletter and people often [manually add a screenshot that links to a
video URL](http://blog.hostbaby.com/2013/03/how-to-add-video-to-your-email-newsletter/). We simplified the process with the ExpressPigeon Video
Widget, making it easy to add a YouTube video to your newsletter that
plays with just one click.

If you ever heard of how [NASA designed a Zero Gravity Space
pen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Pen) while the Russians simply used pencils, you will see that our
solution for embedding videos into emails is similar to that of the
Russian pencil :)

3.  **Make final edits & send.** You can easily drag and drop your video
    within the section you are editing in your newsletter. You can
    choose to center, left-align, or right-align. Once you are happy
    with video location, you are ready to send your newsletter!
    customize formatting.

When a subscriber opens the newsletter, he or she will see the video
where you placed it (with a large play icon at the center of the video).
Clicking the video takes the user to a new window and the video plays
automatically.

> go LIVE when you "Send or Schedule".*

Adding videos that actually play is essential to a successful email
campaign. We hope you enjoy painlessly embedding YouTube videos into
your future emails. Remember, it&apos;s just a few clicks for you to embed,
and one click for your subscribers to enjoy. Happy marketing!
