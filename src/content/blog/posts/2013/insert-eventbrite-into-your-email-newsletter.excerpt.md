Our mission is to make your email marketing
experience as simple and powerful as possible. We are currently
developing [new widgets](expresspigeon-launches-email-newsletter-widgets)
and integrations every month and are super excited to announce that ExpressPigeon and Eventbrite
are now fully integrated. We are such good friends that you can pull event information
from Eventbrite directly into your newsletter with just a few clicks.

The process is simple: create an event webpage in Eventbrite, integrate
your accounts, then design &amp; send beautiful invitations from
ExpressPigeon.

How does Eventbrite integration work with ExpressPigeon?
