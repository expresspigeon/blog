The holiday shopping season is well underway and nothing screams holiday
spirit like \$7+ billion in online sales from Thanksgiving through Cyber
Monday ([comScore](http://www.comscore.com/)). Shoppers who elected to avoid kicking and
screaming went to their digital devices and racked up purchases that
brought online holiday sales up over 20% from last year.

E-retailers around the world launched extensive internet marketing
campaigns to tap into the holiday rush. Black Friday and Cyber Monday
came and went, but e-retailers have an especially important week ahead
of them. In fact, today marks the beginning of a four-day period that
historically accounts for more online revenue than Black Friday and
Cyber Monday combined ([Custora](https://www.custora.com/pulse)). So how do e-retailers capitalize on
this important week of business?
