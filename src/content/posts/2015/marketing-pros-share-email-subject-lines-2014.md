Someone in your audience is probably checking her email as we speak. You
only have seconds to grab her attention with an engaging email subject
line.

The headlines of email marketing play an important role in whether or
not your emails get opened. According to the latest [email marketing
statistics](/blog/2014/01/06/email-marketing-statistics-2014/)…

**Nearly one third of email recipients open email based on subject line
alone. [tweet this](http://ctt.ec/z9woa)**

I’m not discounting the importance of sending email that your audience
actually wants. Without great content, your subject line becomes
useless.

The best subject lines give your subscribers a reason to open your email
and effectively introduce your email content. But there’s no perfect
formula to get great results.

**Every sender has its own audience and unique brand voice.**

So instead of elaborating on how to write perfect subject lines, I
thought it would be best to ask the pros what’s working for them.

I reached out to hundreds of entrepreneurs, bloggers, CMO’s and other
marketing professionals and asked them to send over their top email
subject lines of 2014.

*Let’s see what they had to say…*

## Vertical Measures

## [Vertical Measures](http://www.verticalmeasures.com/)

is a content, search, and social marketing company.

**1. Why I Am No Longer President of Vertical Measures**[tweet this](http://ctt.ec/_8E7m)

Being direct works, especially if you send a personal message from
someone on your team. This subject line is especially strong coming from
a high-level executive, but you can use a first-person approach for a
message from just about anyone on your team.

*Subject Line Formula: “Why I Am No Longer [Title] of [Company]“*

**2. What a great webinar!**[tweet this](http://ctt.ec/C4p1X)

Your audience probably wants to hear about something great. But mostly,
they don’t want to miss out on it. This subject line triggers an
anxious, excited feeling and promises to tell your audience what they
missed or might miss if they don’t open your email.

*Subject Line Formula: “What a great [something]!*

**3. How Google’s Panda 4.0 may (or may not) affect you**[tweet
this](http://ctt.ec/LQHR2)

If something happened, and it may affect your audience, this subject
line is a great example of how to engage them. You can apply this to
pretty much any newsworthy event or situation that may have an impact on
your audience.

*Subject Line Formula: “How [something] may (or may not) affect you”*

## [Neil Patel](http://neilpatel.com)

is the Co-founder & VP of Marketing
at KISSmetrics and the Co-founder of Crazy Egg. He also runs a popular
online marketing blog called Quicksprout.

1. **[insert first name], it’s easier than robbing a bank…** ( [tweet this](http://ctt.ec/6h656) )
Your audience probably wants to know how to make money and doesn’t want
to rob a bank to do it. The personalization and loudness of this subject
line make it stand out.

2. **hey, have you seen this?** ( [tweet this](http://ctt.ec/3ad3U) )
The ambiguity of this subject line makes it especially intriguing.
Nobody wants to miss out on something that they haven’t seen, especially
coming from a sender they trust.

3. **[insert first name], i have some bad news for you :(** ( [tweet this](http://ctt.ec/5p6uL) )
Bad news is especially engaging when it comes from someone who usually
sends good news and useful emails. Make sure you have a good reason to
“scare” your audience.

Neil shared a takeaway on his top email subject lines of 2014:

> If you notice all of the subject lines are lower case as if a friend
> was casually emailing you. I’ve found that subject lines that are
> lower case and casual tend to get the most opens.



## [Hubspot](http://hubspot.com)

is an inbound marketing SAAS product that
helps companies generate traffic, convert leads, and close sales.

Rather than sending over three specific subject lines, Hubspot shared
three approaches that work great for their audience. Let’s take a look:

1. **An Offer To Help**: A short, sweet offer to help has been our highest performing email
subject line because it’s not about you, it’s about the recipient.

2. **A Simple Question**: Nobody wants to overthink their email, so asking a concise, simple
question often drives engagement and opens a productive conversation
with a prospect, lead, or customer.

3. **A Very Clear Name of An Offer**: People value clarity, so providing the name of a very clear offer (for
example: **Free Ebook: How To Do X** - gets to the heart of their marketing
challenge and helps them act on it quickly.


## [Wordstream](http://www.wordstream.com/)

offers online marketing tools
and software products designed to make search marketing campaigns more
organized and profitable.

**1. Welcome to Wordstream – We Love Agencies** [tweet
this](http://ctt.ec/b8hjV)

People are usually curious about why you love them. This subject line
targets a specific segment of a general email audience – agencies. You
can use a similar approach for a welcome email to one of your segmented
audiences.

*Subject Line Formula: Welcome to [Company] – We Love [Subscriber
Segment]*

**2. How’s it going?** [tweet this](http://ctt.ec/Ca84q)

This subject line is as personal as it gets and focuses on your
audience. It shows that you care. This example can work for a personal
message from someone on your team or a general offer to help.

*Subject Line Formula: How’s it going?*

**3. More Keyword Research Tips [Free Guide]** [tweet this](http://ctt.ec/UywG3)

Sometimes, the best subject lines are those that provide a clear offer
for your audience. If your audience values the offer, this simple
approach helps them take action quickly.

particularly engaging. The email itself explained to the audience how
EonFire set up their systems to take a disaster-free, unplugged trip to
Europe.

*Subject Line Formula: Disaster in [Location]*

**2. no subject line (seriously, they left it blank)** [tweet this](http://ctt.ec/lQ45b)

Leaving a subject line blank is rare in email marketing. But once you
build trust with your audience, a blank subject line can spark
curiosity. It worked especially in this instance because the email
itself explained how important it is to deliver valuable content to
email subscribers.

*Subject Line Formula: no subject line*

**3. I’m leaving, but EOFire is in good hands** [tweet this](http://ctt.ec/ee04r)

If you or someone on your team that has built a strong relationship with
your audience is going out of town, let your audience know. This subject
line makes the audience wonder if John is leaving forever, and
thankfully the email reminds them he’ll be back soon!
