If you have kids, you&apos;ve probably told them several times: think before
you speak. The idea is simple and it&apos;s a basic principle of
communicating with other people - before you say something, try to
imagine how your words will affect the other person. Although sending an
email is somewhat different than speaking face to face, the bottom line
is email is still human communication.

Now, imagine yourself on the receiving side. Actually, you don&apos;t have to
imagine: just open your email and look at all the messages that are
there before you start the task of deleting everything you don&apos;t want.
While email providers are becoming better and better at filtering SPAM,
some of it still seeps into our inboxes. Whenever you see it, I&apos;m pretty
sure it strikes a nerve as you press that delete button. Your goal as an
email marketer is to never strike that nerve in your audience!

My advice, then, is this: whenever you send a message to a list, try to
imagine yourself on the receiving side. Email communications is not much
different from other ways we communicate: people will only listen if
they are interested in your topic.

How do you make sure that people are genuinely interested? There are a
lot of ways, but the most important is to have information they need.
Period. It&apos;s hard to say what this information is but you that&apos;s how you
distinguish yourself. Whether it&apos;s a statement of services, a schedule
of performances, coupons for people previously bought stuff, or anything
else, the principle remains the same: your audience should already be
interested in your message.

The best way to ensure that you have an engaged audience (and to avoid
issues with the [CAN-SPAM](http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)
act, is to follow the Double Opt-In loop.
Here&apos;s how this works:

Let&apos;s say you have some important information. The loop begins when a
person who&apos;s interested gives you an email address so you can send more
up-to-date information â€“ that&apos;s the first opt-in. For the second opt-in,
you ask this person to confirm that he or she indeed wants you to send
them email communications. When they reply to your request, you&apos;ve
closed the loop: your trade has let you know twice that he or she is
really interested, and you have permission to send messages to that
email address.

ExpressPigeon uses a double-opt system that makes it easy for you to
build lists. All you have to do is to create a new [subscription form](${blog_base_url}/2013/11/18/custom-email-subscription-form/)
and embed it into your website. When customers visiting your site becomes
so excited with your information, they will happily provide their email
addresses on the subscription form to keep it coming. When they submit
the form, we will send them a response asking them to confirm their
enrollment. When they confirm their interest by clicking a link in the
confirmation email, they have closed the loop, and you have one more
happy customer who will be very unlikely to press the dreaded SPAM
button!

However, at no point should you relax! To keep your subscribers happy
and to get more people subscribing to your content, you have to make it
interesting and relevant.

Happy email marketing!
