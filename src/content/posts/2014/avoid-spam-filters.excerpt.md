Spam filters are often overlooked, undervalued programs working hard to
make us happier and more productive. They keep our inboxes clean and we
barely ever notice them. But like all things designed by humans, spam
filters are not perfect. The reason we love them as subscribers is the
same reason we hate them as senders; they are very protective of the
inbox. And for all of the good they do, we usually only notice them when
they block our email campaigns. It's painful to see our hard work end up
in the spam folder. We all want our email to get delivered. To get past
spam filters you must first understand what they do.
