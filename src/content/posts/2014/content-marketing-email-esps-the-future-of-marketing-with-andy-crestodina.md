## Content Marketing

**Some businesses don't have resources to develop a full-blown content
marketing program. What are the most essential ingredients to content
marketing success?**

When you break it down, content marketing comes
down to just a few things.

1.  Creating something useful that answers questions your audience is
    asking.
2.  Making it visible through search (keyword research), social
    (shareable, stimulating and network-friendly) and email (gets opened
    and grows your list).
3.  Measuring what’s working and optimizing your approach accordingly.

You don’t need to do this every day. Depending on the competition in
your niche, monthly may be enough to start building relevance. If there
is a lot of competition, you’ll need to be more focused and structured.
Websites [organized around content
hubs](http://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/content-hubs/) often do well, even
against big competitors. Content marketing is time consuming and slow,
especially at first, but if you don’t do it, someone else in your
industry will. Your audience is looking for information and someone is
winning the battle for their attention. Someone is answering their
questions, becoming relevant, being shared and staying top of mind. If
you’re not being helpful to your audience with great information,
promoted well, don’t be surprised if you become less relevant over time
and your competitors emerge as influencers of your audience.

## Email Marketing

**Why does email play such an important role in content marketing?**


Email is possibly the most important content promotion tool there is.
There’s a saying among social media marketers: “Don’t Build on Rented
Land.” It means that not everything in your marketing is owned by you.
You don’t own Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google. But you do own your
website, your content and your email list. That’s one big reason email
is important. There are others: virtually everyone uses email. Email is
permission based. Email is easily measured. Email is the number one
method for sharing content. Email marketing is absolutely critical in
content marketing.

**You run a thriving email program at your web design
and development company, Orbit Media. Why is email marketing important
for your business?**

People need a new website once every 3-5 years. If
we have a great conversation with someone who doesn’t need us at the
moment, we need an efficient way to keep in touch with them for the next
several years. Email is the answer. It’s an autopilot mechanism for
keeping in touch with loads of people for years, until that day when
they need our services. If our content (delivered via email) has been
helpful to them for the last few months and years, we’ve got a better
chance of being top of mind. Bottom line, along with search optimization
and social media, email is one of the [three main website traffic
sources](http://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/website-traffic-sources/). How
could we ignore it?!

## Email Service Providers

**In your book [Content
Chemistry](http://www.orbitmedia.com/content-chemistry), you mention
that an [email service provider](http://expresspigeon.com) is one of
five essential tools for content marketing. What characteristics should
you focus on when selecting an ESP for your business?**

Here are some of the big criteria for selecting an ESP:

1.  Deliverability: It should be 99% or close to it.
2.  Easy Setup: The first time you setup your email template, it
    shouldn’t take 6 hours of design and programming time.
3.  Easy Management: After it’s all set up, creating subsequent emails
    should not be difficult.
4.  Reports: They should be easy to read and very pretty. Beatiful
    reports somehow have a way of motivating the marketer to pay close
    attention.
5.  Support: In a distance fifth place is support. An ESP should be
    self-service, but there are times when you need a little help. It’s
    nice when help is available.

**You left Mailchimp over a year ago for ExpressPigeon. Why the
switch?**

We took a close look at
[ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com) and knew right away it would
be an easy switch. The tools for creating and managing emails are the
best I’ve ever seen.

**Since flying with ExpressPigeon, has your email
marketing process changed?**

The time is takes to manage our email
program has gone down. Deliverability is as good as it ever was.

## The Future Of Marketing

**In Content Chemistry you talk about the history and evolution of
marketing. How do you see marketing evolving over the next five years?
How do you see email marketing and content marketing in the mix?**

Lots of niches are getting more crowded, so the winners will be mostly in two
camps: those that produce more detailed, practical, honest content, and
those that produce content is higher quality formats, videos, events and
podcasts. Of course, both of these work beautifully with email. Every
serious marketer I know is aggressively [growing their email
list](${blog_base_url}/2014/05/18/101-ways-to-grow-your-email-list/).
It’s the main factor in long-term growth. If you do everything else
right, but leave out email marketing, you’ll have to work much harder
for much longer to get the same results...
