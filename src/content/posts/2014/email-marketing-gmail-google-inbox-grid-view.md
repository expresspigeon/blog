Google is rolling out a [field
trial](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-new-more-visual-way-to-view-your.html)
for Gmail users to test out a "Grid View" for promotional email. The
Grid View offers a Pinterest-style viewing option in the Promotions Tab
that effectively eliminates subject lines when activated.

Google presents the Grid View as a better way for users to find "deals
and offers" they want to know about. But not every email in the
Promotions Tab is a deal or offer. For example, thousands of subscribers
get our email marketing tips by email
and many find them in the Promotions Tab. **So what&apos;s really happening
here?** It appears this is another step in Google&apos;s plan to monetize the
Gmail inbox. It all started when Google [rolled out
Tabs](/blog/2013/08/20/gmail-tabs-trick-under-sleeve/),
which created a clear distinction between promotional, social, and
personal/business email. By separating marketing emails into the
Promotions Tab, Google was able to test inbox ads masked as emails
without causing too much of an uproar. But very few people get excited
about ads showing up in their inboxes, especially when those ads look
like emails. Sounds a lot like spam, doesn&apos;t it? And if you read my post
about [buying email
lists](/blog/2014/02/12/11-reasons-to-never-purchase-an-email-list/),
you&aposd know that sending spam is illegal and punishable by up to $16,000
per email. But what if promotional emails display visually? Could this
make inbox advertising feel less invasive? Is it possible that sending
spam could become an acceptable practice in the form of inbox
advertising? Google seems to be testing these questions with the
introduction of "Grid View". If it sticks, this will create a further
separation between standard email and promotional email. And if
promotional emails look more like banner ads than standard emails, Gmail
users might not be as upset about advertisers invading their inboxes.
**Where is this all going?** For now, the change is likely to make
little impact on [email marketing](http://expresspigeon.com). The
feature is optional, only available to standard Gmail users, and
requires testers to turn it on in the Promotions Tab. There&apos;s also no
sign that Yahoo, Hotmail, or AOL are jumping on board and there&apos;s no
guarantee that the feature will stick. But if we look at the bigger
picture... *It looks like Google is learning from Facebook&apos;s
monetization strategy.* Think about it. Much like Gmail is evolving to
show users "what they want", the Facebook newsfeed evolved to display
content tailored to specific users. Through that evolution, it became
harder and harder for companies to reach their Facebook fans. Today, you
can expect to pay to reach most of your Facebook audience. Is this where
Google hopes to take promotional email? Is it possible that one day we
will have to pay Google and other ISPs to reach our email audiences? Is
pay-to-deliver the future of email marketing? What do you think? Leave a
comment below and let me know!
