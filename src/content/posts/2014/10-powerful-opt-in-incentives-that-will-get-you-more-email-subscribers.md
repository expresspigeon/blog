You probably aren't a fan of people who visit your website, take a look,
and leave. You want some way to keep in touch with visitors and [email
is still the best option](${blog_base_url}/2014/01/06/email-marketing-statistics-2014/).

Smart business owners and bloggers have been enticing visitors to
subscribe to emails for years - usually by offering a newsletter with
tips and tricks. But as attention spans get shorter and people get
busier, it's harder than ever to win over email subscribers.

One of the
most important [ways to attract new subscribers](${blog_base_url}/2014/02/24/16-opt-in-tricks-to-grow-your-email-list/)
is to come up with a subscription gift. I'm sure you're picturing
yourself plugging away for months to come up with the perfect incentive,
but don't give up yet.

**Coming up with a subscription gift is not as
hard as you may think.**

I'm going to introduce you to some of my
favorite ways to create incentive for an email subscription. Every
business is different, so I'm including ideas ranging from simple to
complex. It's up to you to create the perfect incentive for your
audience.

*Let's dive right in...*

## Incentive 1: Create an eBook on

an in-demand topic.** Have you considered writing an ebook? Ebooks are
extremely popular email subscription gifts. Why? If you choose the right
topic for your audience and add unforgettable value, you can build a
list of engaged subscribers who trust you and care about what you have
to say next. Take a look at the ebook KissMetrics offers in exchange for
an email address:


![KissMetrics landing page](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/kissmetricslandingpage.png)


Notice that Kissmetrics covers an important topic in the analytics
industry - measuring data that matters for making "the right decisions".
This ebook targets valuable subscribers for Kissmetrics - people who are
interested in analytics and might eventually purchase its analytics
software subscription. Ideally, you want to create an ebook that
attracts new subscribers, showcases your expertise, and introduces
subscribers to your products or services. *So how can you write an ebook
for your audience?*

1.  **Choose the right topic.**This is not a guessing game. One of the
    best ways to choose an in-demand topic is to find your most viewed
    blog posts and expand on your favorite. Make sure you pick a topic
    you know and care about because you can expect follow-up
    conversation.
2.  **Write your ebook.**Draft an outline, set deadlines, and begin
    writing. Use existing blog posts and competitor ebooks for
    inspiration. An ebook should be conversational like blog posts, but
    more comprehensive. Reach out to a respected friend or connection to
    edit and make final edits yourself.
3.  **Design & upload your ebook.** The cheapest and easiest way to
    present your ebook is to create a dedicated webpage. If you want to
    step it up - create a custom PDF version of your ebook. You can
    outsource on Dribble or Behance but don't forget to get a beautiful
    cover design and a cover thumbnail for your opt-in forms.
4.  **Update your welcome email.******Use ExpressPigeon to add a button
    to your ebook URL in your welcome email. You don't want to promise
    an ebook and not deliver!
5.  **Update opt-in forms.**Update your opt-in forms to tell visitors
    about your amazing ebook. Check out these [opt-in
    tricks](${blog_base_url}/2014/02/24/16-opt-in-tricks-to-grow-your-email-list/)
    to help you with the process.

Is an ebook the perfect incentive for your audience? Or would you
rather...

## Incentive 2: Create an email course

An email course is
an incredibly powerful way to encourage people to sign up for emails.
With an email course, you can deliver information to subscribers broken
into a series of emails that they can digest over a period of time. For
example, Copyblogger offers *Internet Marketing for Smart People*:

![CopyBlogger](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/copyblogger.png)

As you can see, the Copyblogger course introduces subscribers to
Copyblogger's high-performing content through a 20-part email series and
welcomes them into its current email subscription. *So how can you
create an email course for your business?* **1. Identify overall course
subject.** What will you teach subscribers in your email course? You
need to have a clear direction and understand the overall goal of your
email course. Looking at Copyblogger's *Internet Marketing for Smart
People*, it's clear that the goal is to help subscribers "understand &
implement effective online marketing":

![Small Copyblogger](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/smallcopyblogger.png)

One of the best ways to come up with a clear direction is to review some
of your most popular blog posts or ebooks and identify a common greater
goal they are building towards. This will help you come up with a
valuable subject to cover in your email course. **2. Identify & develop
lessons to support overall goal.** What specific lessons can you teach
in your emails to support your overall goal? You should break down your
email course into a series of individual lessons. For example,
Copyblogger offers content marketing, SEO, effective headlines, keyword
research, and more - which all support the greater subject of online
marketing.

![Small Copyblogger](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/smallcb2.png)

Identify lessons you want to teach in your course. Make a list of
content that supports each lesson - blog posts, ebooks, videos,
presentations, podcasts. You can link to this content within emails that
support each lesson. **3. Create emails & landing pages.** Once you have
an overall subject and specific lessons to cover, you're ready to create
your emails. With [ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com), you can
design beautiful emails with no technical knowledge. Some lessons may
require multiple emails whereas others can be explained in just one.
Your emails can link to supporting content or if you need to further
elaborate, you can create a custom landing page for each email in the
course. Use ExpressPigeon's widgets to add beautiful buttons or videos
to your email designs. You can easily duplicate emails to maintain a
consistent look and feel throughout the series. Once you're done
designing your emails, you're ready to... **4. Set up your email
sequence.** You will need to take advantage of the ExpressPigeon
[autoresponder](${blog_base_url}/2012/12/02/autoresponders-put-your-email-marketing-campaings-on-cruise-control/)
feature to deliver your emails. [Read
this](${blog_base_url}/2012/12/02/autoresponders-put-your-email-marketing-campaings-on-cruise-control/)
to learn how to use autoresponders to set up your email sequence. Using
autoresponders, you can set up your emails to deliver at specific
intervals from the time that each new subscriber registers. Once your
course is created, it automatically delivers to new subscribers. **5.
Update your opt-in forms.** Don't forget to promote your new email
course. Neil Patel swears by email courses and even uses one himself to
promote his email subscription. Check out his subscription form for
inspiration:

*Is an email course right for your business? Give it a shot!*


## Incentive 3: Run recurring webinars

Webinars [come highly recommended](http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/09/05/how-to-use-webinars-to-convert-blog-readers-into-customers/)
for converting website visitors into loyal subscribers and customers.
Running weekly or monthly webinars can help you stay ahead of the
competition by showcasing your expertise on the latest industry topic.
In case you're wondering... A webinar is a live video conference where
you can share a presentation or screencast with your audience. Attendees
can ask questions and interact via voice or messaging - one of the most
engaging forms of content marketing there is. Here's an example of one
of Moz's recurring webinars:

![Moz](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/moz.png)

Moz uses webinars to educate their audience on online marketing in an
effort to build their email list and ultimately upsell attendees on Moz
online marketing tools. I'm sure you're wondering how you can use
webinars to build your list. *Let's get into it...*

1.  **Choose the right topic.**Similar to selecting a topic for your
    ebook or audiobook, a great way to find a topic for your webinar is
    to look at your most popular blog posts. Select a topic from one of
    your best posts - how-to's, list posts, and case studies usually
    make for great webinars. Make sure you pick a topic you know and
    care about or you might get crushed in a Q&A.
2.  **Choose your software.**Hosting a webinar comes with a small price
    tag. There are free services, but you're better offer paying for
    quality and capturing leads than messing around with software that
    might crash. Most marketers use
    [GoToWebinar](http://www.gotomeeting.com/online/webinar).
3.  **Promote your webinar.**Creating a blog post to promote your
    webinar is essential to getting the word out. You might want to
    launch the post a month in advance - especially if you are just
    getting started. Use social media and your email lists to let people
    know. Everyone who signs up for your webinar will need to register
    with an email address - good news for you!
4.  **Create your webinar presentation.**Your presentation should be a
    simple slideshow that leaves room for conversation. Remember that
    the focus of a webinar is to educate - if you get too salesy people
    will run away and never come back. Don't forget to prepare a Q&A.
    This is where you really establish yourself as an expert and build a
    deeper connection with your audience.
5.  **Send a follow-up email.**After the webinar finishes, email your
    audience with a special offer and invite them to join your email
    subscription. This is a great way to convert your webinar attendees
    into ongoing subscribers.

While this incentive is not as direct as the others, it certainly is
effective at converting visitors into subscribers and customers. Give it
a shot!

## Incentive 4: Run a recurring contest or giveaway

Let's
say you have a great product but cannot afford to give samples to every
new subscriber. What about running a recurring contest or giveaway?
Giving away something valuable regularly is strong incentive for people
to subscribe. Why wouldn't people want a chance to win something free on
a regular basis? For example, I helped launch [Tiesta Tea](http://tiestatea.com) in the social media space a few years ago. We
gave away free bags of tea on Twitter every Friday and earned thousands
of paying customers in the process.

![Tiesta Tea](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/tiestatealong.png)


Looking back - I could have improved the giveaway by making it exclusive
to email subscribers. Here's what I would do today...

1.  **Choose a giveaway and a time frame.**What product can you give
    away? How often can you afford to give it away? Is this giveaway
    enticing enough to get people excited about your emails? With the
    Tiesta Tea example, we would give away 5-10 free tins of tea every
    Friday.
2.  **Create entry points on your website.**Entry points for the contest
    are your opt-in forms. [Update the
    forms](${blog_base_url}//2014/02/24/16-opt-in-tricks-to-grow-your-email-list/)
    to let people know about your contest. With the Tiesta Tea example,
    your messaging might be: "Sign up for the Tiesta Tea Club for a
    chance to win free tea every Friday."
3.  **Announce winners via email.**You can send an email to all of your
    subscribers on select dates to announce the winners. In the email,
    you can include a special discount for "losers" to encourage them to
    make a purchase.

Running a consistent contest or giveaway is a great way to encourage
people to sign up for emails, stay engaged with your emails, and visit
your blog or store consistently. Is a recurring contest the right
incentive for your audience? Or should you...

## Incentive 5: Club

Create a special club for email subscribers.** What if you could turn your email
list into an exclusive club? Wouldn't people rather be a part of
something special than something they see everyday? The concept is
simple - transform your email list into a "club" or "membership" and
offer subscribers multiple incentives for joining. This is more of a
branding tactic than anything but it can be very effective for building
a list. For example, Pillsbury calls its email subscribers "Members" and
promotes the club heavily on its
website:

![pillsburyoffer](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/pillsburyoffer.png)

Notice that Pillsbury offers members free coupons, samples, and a
newsletter subscription. When you dive deeper, you'll find they also
give members a free calendar and entries to recurring sweepstakes.


*Here's how you can create a club for your business...*

1.  **Come up with a catchy name.**What will the name of your club be?
    It's ideal to make people feel like they are a part of something
    important. What name is cohesive with your brand? Is it a club? A
    membership? A community? It's up to you to decide.
2.  **Choose incentive for subscribers.**What is the value in joining
    the club? People need to know what's in it for them. You can choose
    multiple incentives from this post to generate ideas. Consider
    offering ongoing benefits such as recurring contests or giveaways.
3.  **Update opt-in forms & process.**Be sure to update your opt-in
    forms and process. One of the most fitting [opt-in
    tricks](${blog_base_url}/16-opt-in-tricks-to-grow-your-email-list/)
    to consider is creating a page dedicated to your club and adding it
    to your main menu.

Is creating a club the right way to go for your audience? Or should
you...


## Incentive 6: Record an audio gift

Your audience is busy
and sometimes they need an option to learn on the go. That's where an
audiobook or podcast becomes such a valuable subscription gift.
Developing audio for subscribers gives them an opportunity to listen and
learn - on the way to work, relaxing at home, or driving their kids to
school. See how Audible offers a free audiobook to encourage people to
sign up for its service:

![audiobook](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/audiobook.png)


Why couldn't you offer the same deal to your email subscribers? Would
your audience value a free podcast or audiobook? *Here's how to create
an audio subscription gift...*

1.  **Choose your topic & write the script.**One of the best ways to
    create an in-demand audiobook or podcast is to select a popular blog
    post or ebook and expand on it. If you write conversationally, this
    could be a very simple process.
2.  **Record your audio.**Once your script is ready, you can outsource
    the voiceover on Craigslist or do it yourself at a local studio. If
    you're considering developing a podcast series, you might want to
    look into a USB microphone.
3.  **Upload audio file & create landing page.** Upload your audio file
    to an audio platform like Soundcloud. Make sure you enable free
    downloads for the file. Once uploaded, you can create a custom page
    on your website and embed the audio, with script, for easy
    downloading & streaming.
4.  **Update your welcome email.** You need to add a button or text link
    to direct subscribers to the page with your audio gift.
5.  **Update opt-in forms.**Update your opt-in forms with [these tricks in mind](${blog_base_url}/2014/02/24/16-opt-in-tricks-to-grow-your-email-list/).
    You might want to design a custom cover for your audiobook or
    podcast to make it more visually appealing.

Is an audiobook the ideal subscription gift for your audience? Or should
you...

## Incentive 7: Offer a discount on a product or service

Everyone loves a good deal. Offering a special discount on products or
services is a great way to build your list and encourage subscribers to
make an immediate purchase. Look at how NFL SHOP offers 10% off for new
subscribers only:

![nflshop](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/nflshop.png)

Notice that NFL SHOP uses a custom opt-in form to collect information
about new subscribers. Don't worry... you don't need a major budget to
pull this off. *Let's see how you can offer a discount to
subscribers...*

1.  **Choose your discount.**Will you offer a discount on all products
    or services? Or a specific product or service? Or just a specific
    brand? Are there any products or services you want to exclude from
    the offer? Make sure to choose a deal that is financially
    responsible for you and extremely attractive to your audience.
2.  **Generate a promo code.** Create a custom promo code for your email
    subscription offer. Make sure subscribers can only use it once but
    avoid an expiration date. Why? If subscribers haven't redeemed the
    coupon in a certain time period, you may want to send them a
    reminder email.
3.  **Update your welcome email.** Use
    [ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com) to easily [insert a
    button](${blog_base_url}/2013/10/01/go-wild-making-buttons-in-your-email-campaigns/)
    or text link that directs subscribers to a page where your discount
    applies. Make sure the page only houses products or services that
    are eligible for the offer - you don't want to mislead new
    subscribers.
4.  **Update your opt-in forms.** Now that the offer is in place, you
    need to update your opt-in forms. This might require custom
    development but at the very least, make sure your opt-in copy
    communicates your new offer. Consider testing new [opt-in
    tricks](${blog_base_url}/2014/02/24/16-opt-in-tricks-to-grow-your-email-list/)
    to better transform website visitors into email subscribers.

Offering a discount is a great way to attract attention to your email
subscription, encourage an immediate purchase of your products or
services, and set yourself up for an enticing re-engagement campaign for
inactive subscribers. Is a discount the perfect subscription gift for
your business? Or should you...

## Incentive 8: Offer a free trial membership

Do you sell a product or service that requires recurring
payments? Consider giving away a free trial membership. This attracts
people who are interested in your products or services - exactly the
type of audience you want on your email list. A free trial gives people
a taste of your expertise and a very direct path to becoming paying
customers. Even if they don't covert into customers after the trial
period, you can continue the conversation via email. Check out how BJ's
Wholesale Club offers a free 60-day membership:

![BJswholesale](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/BJswholesale.png)

Notice in the bottom-right corner of BJ's subscription form, visitors
have an option to "Subscribe to BJ's Emails". This is one way to do it.
Another option is to simply require email subscription to have access to
a free trial. Offering a free trial to your website visitors is a great
way to learn more about your prospects. Once you have their emails, you
can easily let them know more about your business and their benefits. Is
a trial membership right for your business? Or should you...

## Incentive 9: Offer free product samples

Sometimes the best way to entice
people to sign up for emails is to give away exactly what you're
selling... Everybody loves free samples. This is especially powerful if
you sell products that people can buy over and over again. For example,
MOO offers free business card samples for website
visitors:

![moobusinesscards](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/moobusinesscards.png)


In order to receive the cards, you have to create a MOO account. Once
you're a member, MOO emails you special offers and reminders to finish
your project. Giving free samples can be a great way to entice people to
sign up for emails and become paying customers. If you have a great
product, can afford to give away samples, and are confident people will
come back for more - this could be the perfect subscription gift for
your business. Will you give away free samples to every new subscriber?
Or should you...

## Incentive 10: Create a quick video for your audience

*Interview yourself...* Use a webcam to record yourself
sharing expertise on your industry with your audience. Offer a few
tricks and ideas and share some stories to help your audience relate.
Upload the video on YouTube and when someone subscribes, share the link
with them. Don't worry that the video is available publicly on your
YouTube channel. If the content of your talk is valuable, subscribers
will appreciate it. Your video should deliver what you promise in your
opt-in forms.

*Create a tutorial video...*

Show people how to do
something the right way and they'll love you for it. Give people a
tutorial video as an email subscription gift, but make it something
important. What can you show your audience how to do that nobody else is
doing better than you? The topic you choose should be something that is
broad enough to engage anyone in your audience but different enough to
entice them to sign up for emails. Once you know what to record, you can
create your video. Programs like
[Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) or
[Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) make it easy to
record a screencast - a video of what's happening on your computer
screen. A screencast gives people the visuals they need to follow your
how-to's and they'll be grateful for subscribing. If you're doing
something more hands-on, you can always create a how-to video that shows
the actual process. Don't be afraid to fly different. **Conclusion**
Coming up with the perfect opt-in incentive for your business can be as
simple or as complex as you decide is right for your audience. No matter
what incentive you choose to create, it's essential to give people a
reason to sign up for your emails. You can use all the
[opt-in tricks](${blog_base_url}/2014/02/24/16-opt-in-tricks-to-grow-your-email-list/)
in the world but if you don't offer any incentive, why would anyone
subscribe? Remember, your subscription gift should be...

1.  **Attention grabbing.** The gift should be unique enough to get
    people excited. You can have the most educational gift in the world
    but nobody will ever know unless they subscribe. How can you
    communicate your gift to make it grab visitors?
2.  **Valuable.**Subscribers want to get something out of the gift. If
    it gets their attention but lacks originality or substance, be
    prepared for unsubscribes.
3.  **Brand consistent.**A gift that is valuable but has nothing to do
    with your business can attract subscribers who are only in it for
    the gift. New subscribers who don't care what you have to say aren't
    likely to stick around for the long haul.

Coming up with the perfect subscription gift is ultimately up to you.
Only you will devise the perfect email subscription gift to attract new
subscribers and excite them for what's to come next. So how are you
attracting new subscribers? Have any ideas to add to the list? Leave a
comment below and keep the ideas on flow! :)
