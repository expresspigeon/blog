Email marketing is essential to a successful online marketing strategy.
In fact, [email marketing has an ROI of over 4300%](${blog_base_url}/2014/01/06/email-marketing-statistics-2014/).
Unfortunately, it&apos;s easy for new marketers to make a deadly mistake that
can crush their email marketing program and company reputation:
Purchasing or renting an email list.

So you are new to [email marketing](http://expresspigeon.com) and have a
product or service that you know people will love… If only they had some
way to hear about it. You&apos;ve heard rumors about list-building over the
years so you hit Google and search for “purchase email list”. Lucky for
you, there are a few exciting sponsored searches:

![](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/Purchase-Email-List.png)

Goldmine! All you have to do now is swipe your credit card and you&apos;ll
have a list of “verified” and “opt-in” email addresses from “trusted”
vendors. Right?

WRONG!

The “quick fix” of list purchasing is attractive for a new marketer but
ugly for those with experience. List purchasing comes with dangerously
harmful and long-lasting consequences. Before we dive into reasons why
you should never buy or rent email lists, let&apos;s get a better
understanding of the three main email list acquisition options.

## Email List Acquisition Options

1.  **Purchase an email list.** There are hundreds of websites and
    companies that sell email lists. These lists generally include
    names, email addresses, and other personal information and are often
    categorized by demographic.

2.  **Rent an email list.** Renting an email list is a way of
    "borrowing" an email list from a list provider or partner company.
    You send an email through a provider to a “targeted” list of email
    addresses that you will never see.

3.  **Build your email list organically.** This is the only way to
    develop a healthy email marketing program. First, you must [sign up
    with an email service provider](https://expresspigeon.com/access/registration?plan=free)
    like ExpressPigeon and then you can generate an opt-in list. An
    opt-in list grows as people willingly sign up to receive your
    emails.

I know what you&apos;re thinking… Why don&apos;t I just buy an “opt-in” list
rather than build one myself? It&apos;s simple: [Sending spam is
illegal](http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)
and punishable with fines up to $16,000 per email. Still want to beat
the system?

*Let&apos;s take a look at 11 reasons you should never purchase an email
list...*

### Reason \#1: For-sale lists are built through questionable collection methods

Think about it. Reputable companies would never sell their
email lists. So where do vendors acquire email addresses to generate
for-sale lists? One such method is banner ad deceit. If you&apos;ve ever been
prompted to "Win an iPad" or "Claim Your Free Vacation", you&apos;ve
witnessed this firsthand. People who click these ads must answer a
series of questions and provide detailed personal information for a
"chance to win". Unfortunately, there is usually no actual chance to
win, and people who submit their information often end up on "targeted"
email lists. Not exactly your ideal targets.\
\
 Another popular email address collection method is called email
harvesting, where email list vendors deploy bots to crawl selected
websites, social networks, and forums and store collected email
addresses in a database. This database becomes, lucky for you, an email
list that you can purchase. Sounds like a great list of people to email,
eh?

![](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/emailrobot.png)

Let&apos;s not forget about industry events. Ever signed up for a chance to
win a car or checked off a few random boxes during registration? You are
truly the lucky winner! Your email address just made it onto an email
list that vendors buy from industry events and sell back to email
marketing newbies later on. Those little checkboxes can be so
deceiving... And this trickery is amplified digitally. List vendors
collect emails through online service signups, masking them in the
little checkboxes that we just mentioned but continuously forget to
uncheck. Once you&apos;ve checked a box for "updates from SHADY COMPANY and
our partners", you made it onto an email list for rent! List building
vendors market these lists as "rentals", where you pay to reach an
"opt-in" list. Unfortunately, the people on the list didn&apos;t opt-in for
emails from you.

### Reason \#2: Purchased email lists are deceitfully advertised

Email list vendors have mastered the game of luring in new
email marketers. They are experts at making you feel like you just found
the "secret" to instant email marketing success. Unfortunately, their
expertise is misleading for you and doesn&apos;t cover the negative
consequences of sending emails to a purchased list. While buzzwords like
"opt-in", "targeted", and "clean" may make you feel warm and cozy, these
descriptors couldn&apos;t be further from the truth. Purchased email lists
are never opt-in (did people really sign up for email updates from
anyone that buys the list?) and they certainly are not targeted with any
accuracy. The fact that vendors even mention the idea of "clean" is a
giveaway to the fact that purchasing lists is a dirty game. The only way
to build an opt-in, targeted, clean email list is to do it yourself.


### Reason \#3: Renting an email list is as shady as it sounds

While there are a lot of companies using email to promote their partners
ethically and responsibly, there are also a lot of companies renting
their email lists to third parties. How do rental lists work? Companies
sell the opportunity to send an email to their email list. Sounds shady,
right? That&apos;s because it is. If someone opts-in for an email from one
company, do you really think they are consciously opting in to receive
emails from some other company? No chance.

### **Reason \#4: An email list has no value in itself

Unless you&apos;re merging email lists with a
partner or acquiring a new company (send a reengagement opt-in
campaign), buying a valuable email list is impossible. A good email list
is [so valuable](${blog_base_url}/2014/01/06/email-marketing-statistics-2014/)
that nobody in their right mind would sell it and jeopardize destroying
those hard-earned relationships. Think about it. An email list is only
as valuable as the attention of the people on it and the relationship
you have with those people.

### Reason \#5: People on purchased lists don&apos;t know you.

The email addresses on a purchased list are connected
to real people who are not expecting any communication from you and have
no idea who you are. Even if your list is full of real people, imagine
how annoyed they will be when they receive your email completely out of
the blue. Not exactly a warm introduction to your company...

### Reason\#6: Sending emails to purchased lists will crush your Sender Score

A [Sender Score](https://www.senderscore.org/) is your IP address
reputation indicator. Every IP address, or email source, receives a
numerical rating Sender Score on a scale of 0-100. This number,
determined by a complex algorithm, is based on a variety of inputs
including deliverability & spam reports.

![SenderScore](${blog_base_url}/images/2014/SenderScore.png)

Purchased lists are usually very high in bounce rate & spam reports and
can crush your Sender Score. Not only will a lower Sender Score limit
your ability to get emails into your recipients&apos; inboxes, it will also
prevent you from working with a reputable ESP.

### Reason \#7: Any reputable ESP will kick you to the curb.

If you use reputable [email marketing service](http://expresspigeon.com) or plan to eventually, you
cannot use purchased email lists. Here at ExpressPigeon, we do not allow
customers to use purchased, rented, or third party lists of any kind. We
have no problem saying goodbye to paying customers that abuse our [Terms
of Service](https://expresspigeon.com/terms). In fact, our fine to
spammers is $1,000 or 60x a monthly plan, whichever is greater. We have
had instances of fining people and they have fought with us through
credit card charge-back system... They lost. And don&apos;t forget that every
individual you email has the right to sue you for $16,000.

*So you still want to find an ESP that sends emails to purchased lists?*

If you do
find a shady ESP willing to send spam, you will experience low
deliverability rates. There&apos;s a reason why good ESPs won&apos;t send to
purchased lists. Maintaining our integrity allows us to stay off
blacklists and keeps our IP reputation solid. Any ESP that allows
spammers to send cannot possibly maintain a solid deliverability rate.


### Reason \#8: Purchased lists often contain spam traps.

Big ISPs recycle email addresses as spam traps, which wind up on purchased lists.
The idea is that a dormant email address cannot possibly opt-in for
emails so a sender to a spam trap address is sending spam. Many
purchased lists contain spam traps, and once you send to them, goodbye.
Your ISP may fine you and will likely kick you to the curb and you will
completely trash your IP address. You will also wind up on email
blacklists, or lists of spammers, all over the web. **Reason \#9: Emails
to purchased lists rarely make to the inbox.** Even if you&apos;re not on a
blacklist (yet), emails to purchased lists have low deliverability
rates. Why? Big ISPs like Gmail and Yahoo are getting more and more
advanced at tracking behavior of specific IPs and blocking unsolicited
email. They block the obvious (penis enlargement emails) and have a few
tricks to determine if your email is spam:

1.  How much time does recipient spend viewing email?
2.  Do they scroll down?
3.  Do they enable images?
4.  Other sneaky things.

Once your purchased list emails are marked as spam, don&apos;t expect future
emails to make it into an inbox. ISPs will flag you as a spammer, may
fine you, and can block you from ever sending again. **Reason \#10: You
will create a negative conversation about your brand.** Even if you get
a miracle list and your emails get delivered, think about the possible
negative response from your recipients. Purchased lists are filled with
people you don&apos;t know. When they receive an email from your company out
of the blue, what do you expect their reaction will be? Social media
makes it easier than ever for people to bad mouth your brand. If you
think recipients of your cold email will mark as spam or delete
silently, think again. **Reason \#11: Your company reputation will be
crushed.** Think you had a successful run sending to purchased lists? I
have bad news for you. Short-term results are possible but the long-term
consequences will haunt you. Once your Sender Score nosedives and you
[find yourself on blacklists](http://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx), it
can take years before you can earn back a good reputation. It&apos;s clear to
see that purchasing email lists is a bad deal. If those eleven reasons
weren&apos;t enough for you, let me remind you.... Cold calling and cold
emailing is just plain obnoxious.

To sum it up, purchasing email lists is a bad practice. Don&apos;t get stuck
in the past and kill your company&apos;s future. So... How can you build an
email list the right way?

    offer them an opportunity to opt-in to receive emails from you in
    the future. It&apos;s important to explain what value you will add and
    why they should sign up. Think about offering existing customers a
    special deal for joining.
