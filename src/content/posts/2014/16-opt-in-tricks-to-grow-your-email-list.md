Building an email list is what smart business owners do. After all, you
need some way to convert short-lived traffic into lasting relationships.
How else will you maintain direct communication with prospects and
customers?

There are a few important steps to building an email list.
One of the most essential steps is optimizing your opt-in setup &
process to convert visitors into subscribers. But before you begin, do
this:

1.  **Sign up with an email service provider.** An [email service
    provider](http://expresspigeon.com) houses your list and gives you
    tools to design, send, and track emails. Once you have an ESP
    account, you are ready to...
2.  **Create incentive for people to subscribe.** You need to offer
    people something to entice them to give you their email address.
    Incentive can range from a tangible giveaway (free eBook) to a
    special offer (product discount) to an exciting explanation of how
    valuable your emails will be.

Once you have something to give away, you need to make it easy for
people to subscribe. This is where opt-in forms come into play. An
opt-in form is an entry point for people to subscribe to emails.

To transform visitors into email subscribers, you need to add opt-in forms
to your site and develop a subscription process that effectively
welcomes them into your email program. Sounds complicated, right?

 > It&apos;s not as tricky as you may think. Let&apos;s dive right in...

## Trick #1: Add an opt-in form to your blog sidebar.

Adding an opt-in form to your
blog sidebar is a great place to start. If you have an active blog, this
is a traffic-heavy area and a great place to attract new subscribers.
You can [add a signup form to the sidebar of a Wordpress site with this
plugin](/blog/2013/11/19/add-expresspigeon-subscription-form-to-wordpress-in-minutes/)
or develop a custom sidebar. Your form should include a message telling
visitors why they should sign up. Take a look at how writer [Jeff
Goins](http://goinswriter.com/) uses his sidebar to promote his
newsletter:

## Trick #2: Add a Hello Bar to the top of your website.

[Hello Bar](%20http://hellobar.com/) is a simple bar that runs across the top
of your website. Within the bar, you can add a custom message and
encourage email signups or direct visitors to a landing page where you
can capture emails later on. See how B2B marketing expert [Diana
Huff](http://www.diannahuff.com/) uses Hello Bar to get subscribers:

## Trick #3: Add an opt-in page to your main menu.

Add a "Subscribe"
or "Updates" or "Connect" page to your main menu and give your opt-in
form a home of its own. A page dedicated to your email updates can help
reel in your more easily distracted visitors. See how blogging
mastermind [Blog Tyrant](http://blogtyrant.com) does it
here:

![](/blog/images/2014/blogtyrantupdates.png)

Now that you have a page dedicated specifically to your subscription
form, it&apos;s important to make it accessible. Consider using a custom URL
for your signup page. This makes it easier for people to share in those
rare moments where they communicate in person. ;) **Trick \#4: Create a
custom opt-in "slider" on your homepage.** One of the best pieces of
real estate you have on your website is the slider section right below
your main menu on your home page. If your main call to action on your
site is your email subscription, consider building a custom email signup
slider. This is especially popular for bloggers.

## Trick #5: Prompt visitors with opt-in form popups.


There is [a lot of evidence](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/5-digit-email-lists/) to indicate
that popups, when tastefully done, can grow your email list. Popups
collect email addresses or provide visitors with a link to important
content where addresses are collected later on. I was reading
Quicksprout the other day and this popped up:

![](/blog/images/2014/emailpopupneil.png)

While popups can be annoying and are not a fit for every business, there
are many thought leaders that swear by their results. To add a popup to
your site, you can use a WordPress plugin like [Popup Domination](http://www.popupdomination.com/) or build something custom.
Remember to give visitors ample time or a few clicks before triggering
the popup, or you might scare them off.

## Trick #6: Add an opt-in form to the footer of blog posts.

Adding a signup form to the footer of your blog posts is an excellent way to transform new and returning blog
readers into engaged email subscribers. We know from experience. By
adding a custom HTML signup form to the footer of our posts, we
experienced a 156% increase in our email signup rate in just 30 days.


Creating a custom signup form requires contracting a graphic designer
and a developer. Check out oDesk or Elance for developers and Dribbble
or Behance for designers.

## Trick #7: Add an opt-in form to every page on your site.

Adding signup forms to every website page gives visitors
a call to action that follows them through their full-site browsing
experience. Websites can be noisy and this prevents potential
subscribers from falling through the cracks.

## Trick #8: Write amazing opt-in form copy.

-   **The headline** should grab attention and tell people exactly what
    they get by signing up for your emails. Example: "Get Your Free
    Content Marketing Toolkit"
-   **The body** should qualify people and nudge them to take action.
    Example: "If you&apos;re serious about content marketing, enter your
    email address below to receive the Content Marketing Toolkit."
-   **The call-to-action** should be simple and immediate. Example: "Get
    The Toolkit."

Here&apos;s a great [opt-in form example](/blog/2014/01/17/6-food-fanatics-will-make-you-rethink-your-subscription-forms/)
from Michael Aagaard at [Content Verve](http://contentverve.com/):
![](/blog/images/2014/contentverveoptin.png)


## Trick #9: Add something extra to your opt-in forms.

-   **Include the dollar value.** If you&apos;re offering an eBook or Toolkit
    or online course in your opt-in form, add the dollar value. Example
    "Get The Free Content Marketing Toolkit (Valued at Over $300)"
-   **Add a testimonial.** A testimonial is great for boosting business.
    If this wasn&apos;t true, Yelp would be out of business. If you don&apos;t
    have any testimonials, survey your favorite subscribers.
-   **Add social proof.** Include a message about how many people
    currently subscribe to your emails. If you have thousands of
    subscribers, people will want to find out what all the hype is
    about. Example: "Join 25,000+ of your peers!"
-   **Include a privacy policy.** People hate spam. Adding a privacy
    policy message and a link to your privacy policy is comforting.
    Example: "We respect your privacy (link)."

Neil Patel really adds something extra on his Quicksprout opt-in form,
and [it works](http://www.quicksprout.com/):

## Trick #10: Keep submission fields limited in opt-in forms.

We all want to know as much as possible about new subscribers. It&apos;s tempting to
ask for more than an email address but people have grown weary of the
ask. Give people comfort and eliminate unnecessary custom fields from
opt-in forms. You can always survey subscribers once you&apos;ve earned their
trust.


## Trick #11: Customize opt-in forms for anticipated traffic surges.

Let&apos;s say you&apos;re about to get featured on a major site and
expect significant referral traffic. You want to transform the guest
readers into email subscribers. Check out the opt-in forms on the
website you will be featured on and shape your form messaging to their
audience.

## Trick #12: Optimize opt-in forms to improve conversion rates.

Test small changes in opt-in forms to improve conversion rates.
Make one small change and test its impact. You can test form location,
design, copy, call-to-action, and more. Small changes such as mixing up
your voice from first to third person or testing a new color scheme can
be effective. Results will help you tailor your entire signup process.

## Trick #13: Develop an original, interactive opt-in form.

Businesses have experimented with everything from 3D graphics to animation to
gamification to spice up signup forms. Coming up with something
completely original and interactive is a great way to grow your list.
One example [we spotted at Get Elastic](http://www.getelastic.com/3-creative-ways-to-get-more-email-opt-ins/)
is an engaging game developed by Sephora in fall 2013. Visitors entered
email addresses to follow a ball that traveled Pinko-style into a slot
where a unique prize was revealed.

## Trick #14: Use double opt-in and create a custom confirmation email.

Once a visitor signs up for emails via one of your conveniently
located and brilliantly designed opt-in forms, you should send them a
confirmation email. This confirmation step, referred to as "double
opt-in", is important to maintaining a quality email list. A
confirmation email is your first direct communication with new
subscribers. It should reflect the look and feel of your brand. Design a
custom newsletter with ExpressPigeon in minutes. Keep it simple. Your
design should prime them for future emails but not distract them from
your main call-to-action: Clicking a confirmation link.

## Trick #15: Create an inviting confirmation page.

It&apos;s amazing (disappointing?) how many subscription confirmations lead to a dead end. When a new
subscriber confirms subscription, you have an opportunity to redirect
them to any URL. Why settle for a simple thank you? Design a custom
confirmation page on your site that welcomes subscribers to the
community. Looking for content to include on the page that is applicable
for your business? Here are a few ideas:

-   Welcome subscriber to community and thank them for joining.
-   Encourage subscriber to add your email address to contact list.
-   Give subscriber option to connect with you on social media.
-   Offer subscriber a link to engaging content on your site.
-   Prompt subscriber to tell their friends about your email
    subscription.

Here&apos;s a great example from blogging expert

## Trick #16: Create a welcome email to remember.

A welcome email is your first email to new subscribers. Give them something that excites
them for what&apos;s to come next. Deliver your free giveaway (as promised),
thank them for subscribing, and prepare them for what&apos;s coming next.
This is also a great time for a surprise! Consider offering a special
"thank you" discount. See how getting-things-done expert Gregory Ciotti
does this at

![](/blog/images/2014/sparringmindwelcome.png)

Notice how Gregory includes links to his best articles and gives a warm
welcome that gets you excited for what&apos;s to come next. Figure out what
works for you and keep it authentic! **CONCLUSION** It&apos;s not easy to
build an email list, but with a strategic opt-in process that fits your
business, you can build a very profitable email list in just a few
months. What opt-in tricks do you use to convert visitors into
subscribers?
