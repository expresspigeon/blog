Spam filters are often overlooked, undervalued programs working hard to
make us happier and more productive. They keep our inboxes clean and we
barely ever notice them. But like all things designed by humans, spam
filters are not perfect. The reason we love them as subscribers is the
same reason we hate them as senders; they are very protective of the
inbox. And for all of the good they do, we usually only notice them when
they block our email campaigns. It&apos;s painful to see our hard work end up
in the spam folder. We all want our email to get delivered. To get past
spam filters you must first understand what they do.

## What Is A Spam Filter?


Spam filters are programs that identify unwanted or unsolicited emails
and prevent them from reaching inboxes. Major ISPs like Google and
Yahoo! have built-in spam filters and filtering processes to ensure
their users are protected from "junk" email.

## How Spam Filters Identify Spam


Spam filters identify spam based on a long list of criteria, but
generally they consider:

-   Relationship with subscriber
-   Reputation of IP address and sender domain
-   Quality of email subject line, teaser, and content
-   Quality and safety of links in email
-   Presence or absence of images
-   Ratio of images to text and links to text
-   Inclusion of text version of email

This isn&apos;t even close to an exhaustive list of factors that spam filters
consider, but these are likely the most important. The list of spam
factors is growing, because spam filters track subscriber actions to
become better at identifying spam. Spam filters track the following
subscriber actions:

-   If subscriber opens email or not
-   The amount of time subscriber takes to read email
-   If subscriber scrolls to bottom of email or not
-   If subscriber enables images
-   If subscriber flags email as spam
-   What tags subscriber applies to email
-   What folders subscriber adds email to
-   If subscriber forwards email
-   The number of times subscriber opens email

Tracking subscriber actions gives spam filters valuable data to shape
their complex ranking formulas. Spam filters use these formulas,
comprised of weighted spam factors, to determine an email spam score
that is unique for each email to every individual subscriber. Sound
complicated? This simply means that the same email for two different
people could be ranked differently. Spam for one, ham for another. Spam
filters rely heavily on subscriber engagement to learn how to become
better at identifying what is and isn&apos;t spam for each individual
subscriber. **How Spam Filters Deal With Spam** Spam filters use the
spam score to determine what action to take next. An email with a
passing score moves to the subscriber&apos;s inbox. If an email is flagged as
spam, filters generally take one of the following actions:

-   Send email to spam folder
-   Block or bounce email for policy reasons
-   Slow delivery rate from sender (stuck in a tar pit)
-   Block email from sender
-   Block email from IP address
-   Block all emails from a range of IP addresses

Big ISPs such as Google are good at identifying spam on a case-by-case
basis and sending it to the spam folder. But no spam filter is perfect.
It is impossible to guarantee that every opt-in email will make it to
the inbox of each subscriber. However, there are steps we can take to
give our email a good chance of reaching our audience.

*Let&apos;s dive right in...*

## Tactic \#1: Produce quality email content.

The best way to get past
spam filters is to send high quality email to people who know you and
expect to hear from you. If you give people what they want and expect,
you can expect healthy subscriber engagement. You also want to take care
of the following:

1.  **Clean coding.**Coding yourself is not for faint-hearted because it
    is incredibly difficult to code email by yourself. If you don&apos;t want
    to do it, use ExpressPigeon&apos;s drag-and-drop editor which produces
    clean, 100% compatible code for you.
2.  **Professional formatting.**CAPS LOCK, dozens of exclamation points,
    and wild colors should be avoided. BELIEVE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3.  **Wise words.**Avoid spammy words and phrases. Don&apos;t mention getting
    rich quick or making tons of money or getting free everything today.
4.  **Healthy linking.**Don&apos;t send emails with 40 links and minimal
    text. This is a popular tactic by spammers. Keep a balanced text to
    link ratio.
5.  **Balanced images.**Spammers often use images to send &apos;special
    offers&apos; because spam filters can&apos;t read them easily. Emails that
    contain a large image and very little text are often filtered as
    spam. Keep a balanced text to image ratio.


## Tactic \#2: Read and understand the CAN-SPAM Act.


The CAN-SPAM Act
is a US federal law passed in 2003 that sets the rules for commercial
email. With fines as high as $16,000 for every email that violates the
law, it&apos;s worth understanding. I&apos;m not your lawyer, in fact I&apos;m not a
lawyer at all, but below are a few general tips on how to comply with
the CAN-SPAM Act:

1.  **Do not deceive.**Never use deceptive headers, subject lines,
    reply-to addresses, from-names, or call-to-actions.
2.  **Make unsubscribing easy.**Include an unsubscribe link, which must
    stay live for at least 30 days after sending. Remove unsubscribes
    within 10 days of opt-out. (At ExpressPigeon, we honor instant
    unsubscribes.)
3.  **Include your real mailing address.**You must include your actual
    physical postal address in your email.
4.  **Never send without consent**. Use our [subscription
    forms](/blog/2013/11/18/custom-email-subscription-form/)to
    help people subscribe.

website](http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business).


## Tactic \#3: Use double opt-in.

When building a [signup form](/blog/2013/11/18/custom-email-subscription-form/)
for your email subscription, you have the option with ExpressPigeon to
do single opt-in or double opt-in. We recommend double-opt in, a process
that looks like this:

1.  User subscribes for emails via signup form on your site.
2.  User receives email with confirmation link.
3.  User clicks a confirmation link and is added to your email list.

Double opt-in protects your list from bots and ensures that your
subscribers are real people who want your emails. People who are more
committed are less likely to flag your future email as spam. When you
get a new subscriber using double opt-in, we collect the following
information:

-   Timestamp
-   IP address
-   Browser
-   Operating System

This information protects you. If a subscriber marks you as a spammer in
the future, we have a record to prove that permission was given. Using
double opt-in is a simple way to increase the odds of getting your email
delivered.


## Tactic \#4: Grow your list ethically.

Misleading or deceitful list-building tactics can crush your deliverability. Why? People who
don&apos;t explicitly give you permission to receive your emails don&apos;t want
to hear from you. They are likely to mark your email as spam. A few
examples of what not to do:

-   **Add all of your contacts to your list.**Every person you know does
    not necessarily want your marketing email. Give connections,
    customers and friends an option to subscribe for email before adding
    them. Send them a nice invitation.
-   **Use shady offline list-building tactics.**People who drop a
    business card in a fishbowl or sign up for a chance to win a trade
    show giveaway do not necessarily want email from you. Be clear when
    collecting emails. There are healthy ways to [build an email list
    offline](/blog/2014/05/15/6-quick-tips-to-grow-your-email-list-offline/).
-   **Buy an email list.**It&apos;s a [really bad idea to purchase or rent an
    email
    list](/blog/2014/02/12/11-reasons-to-never-purchase-an-email-list/).
    Not only is it illegal and punishable by US law, it can crush your
    email marketing program and do long-term harm to your brand.
-   **Scrape websites for email addresses.** It goes without saying that
    this will only get you in trouble. Do this, and you&apos;ll probably end
    up on blacklists.

To get past spam filters, you want to attract people who are truly
interested in your email. There are hundreds of[healthy ways to grow
your list](/blog/2014/05/18/101-ways-to-grow-your-email-list/).

## Tactic \#5: Design professional-looking emails.
If your emails look cheap or unprofessional, you can come across like a spammer. Check out
our [newsletter templates](https://expresspigeon.com/gallery) for
inspiration.


## Tactic \#6: Craft relevant and engaging subject lines.

Spam filters and your audience don&apos;t want misleading subject lines. Make sure your
subject line engages subscribers and tells them what your email is
really about. Avoid spammy phrases like "click here" or "open now" or
"act today" or "limited offer". Also, don&apos;t use ALL CAPS or too many
numbers or special characters. Use our [teaser feature](/blog/2012/12/14/increase-email-open-rates-with-a-teaser-line/)
to extend your subject line and entice people to open the email.

## Tactic \#7: Personalize your email.

The more you personalize, the better. The least you can do is address your subscribers by their names.
Use the following text in a subject line or body or an email to do so:
Hi, ${first\_name} Subscribers appreciate receiving an email with a
personal touch. The better your subscribers know you and trust you, the
less likely they are to flag your emails as spam.

## Tactic \#8: Use a human reply-to address.**

Your [reply-to address](/blog/2014/03/03/how-important-is-reply_to-address/)
should be a real company email connected to someone human who your
subscribers can communicate with. Avoid using an address like
do-not-reply@yourcompany.com. This sends a selfish message to your
audience and limits the possibility for healthy two-way communication.

## Tactic \#9: Use descriptive text instead of URLs as link text.**

Spam filters try to block phishing attacks, where attackers encourage readers
to click on a well-known text URL that links to a different URL
(attacker website). For example, a victim of a phishing attack would see
"http://chase.com" in an email but upon clicking the link, they would be
directed to "http://attackerwhostealsyouridentity.com". Because of this
shady tactic, you should avoid using URLs as link text. Instead, use
descriptive text. Every link in this blog post is an example of
descriptive text. Here at ExpressPigeon, we offer [phishing attack and
composer protection](/blog/2011/12/21/email-phishing-attack-and-composer-protection/)
to make sure you never forget.

## Tactic \#10: Start sending email right away.

You should be sending
email the minute you get your first subscriber. Why? If you wait until
your list reaches a certain size before sending, your first email will
seem like a total surprise to early subscribers. And what do subscribers
do when they are startled? They mark emails as spam. Instead of being
stagnant, [jump-start your list](/blog/2014/05/05/7-overlooked-ways-to-jump-start-your-email-list-today/)
and send email from day one.


## Tactic \#11: Be consistent with send frequency.

If you don&apos;t send
emails for long periods of time, and suddenly send, subscribers may
forget about you and mark the email as spam. If you&apos;re sending too
often, subscribers may get irritated and ignore you completely. Finding
the right frequency for your email program requires testing, but
consistency is key. Once subscribers know how often you send, they
expect to receive emails at the same rate moving forward. When you meet
their expectations, subscribers are more likely to become engaged
readers and less likely to mark your emails as spam.

## Tactic \#12: Use a corporate email account as your sender address.

If you use a major ESP and send email using a personal email address
such as paul@yahoo.com or paul@aol.com, ISPs like Google will block your
email. Why? Yahoo! and AOL tell them to! The solution is to use your
corporate email address or owned domain. Learn more about [DMARC and
what it means to marketers](/blog/2014/06/11/dmarc-in-english-what-it-means-to-marketers/).

## Tactic \#13: Avoid spam traps.**

If an email address hasn&apos;t been used
in years, ISPs sometimes convert that email address into a spam trap,
called a honeypot. You will never know if an email address is a spam
trap. The best way to avoid spam traps is to never scrape websites or
buy rented lists. As long as you follow ethical list-building tactics,
you should be fine. We recommend running a reengagement campaign every
six months to make sure you have a healthy, engaged list.

## Tactic \#14: Make sure you are not on blacklists.

ESPs advertise
which IP addresses they send from. Reputable ESPs (like ExpressPigeon)
track this themselves, so you don&apos;t have to worry about it. If you are
sending from your own IP address, you can use tools like [MX
Toolbox](http://mxtoolbox.com/) to verify and get alerted if your IP
gets on a blacklist.


## Tactic \#15: Include a text version of your email.

It&apos;s easier to hide shady call-to-actions in HTML than it is in text. Even if you know
people are not opening up a text version of email, it&apos;s not a bad idea
to include it. At ExpressPigeon, you can easily convert your HTML design
to text. We offer a simple "Text Version" button that allows you to pull
the text from our drag-and-drop editor. Nowadays, most spam filters are
advanced enough to dig into HTML, so including a text version is not as
important as it once was. However, adding a text version can help you if
you have subscribers using outdated email services or text-only reading
settings.

## Tactic \#16: Use a reputable email service provider.

The best thing
you can to do to get past spam filters is to use a reputable ESP like
ExpressPigeon. We work hard to make sure your emails get delivered. You
