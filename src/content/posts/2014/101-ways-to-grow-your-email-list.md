Imagine having the ability to reach thousands of people at the click of
a button. Once you learn to build an opt-in email list, this will be
your reality.

## Every Business Needs An Email List

Every single one of your current and future customers has an email
address, a direct line into the palm of their hands. Email is one of the
most personal and economical ways to stay in touch. In fact, [current
statistics](http://blog.expresspigeon.com/2014/01/06/email-marketing-statistics-2014/)
show that email marketing performs better than social media, PPC,
content marketing, offline direct marketing, online display advertising,
mobile marketing, and affiliate marketing. So where do you begin?

## You Need An Email Service Provider

An [email service provider](http://expresspigeon.com) is a company that
gives you tools to send marketing email. Here are some of the most
important criteria for choosing an ESP that is right for your business:

1.  **Deliverability.** You need to make sure your emails make it to
    inboxes. Otherwise, the rest of your work is wasted. The most
    reputable ESPs (including ExpressPigeon) hover around 99%
    deliverability.
2.  **Setup.**  Setting up your ESP account should be a painless process.
    Whether you're uploading a list or designing your first email, you
    shouldn't need hours to make it happen. The best ESPs are
    user-friendly and intuitive.
3.  **Management.** Managing your email campaigns should be easy. If you
    find it difficult to navigate an ESP, it will only get more
    complicated as you develop your email program.
4.  **Tracking.**  Reports should be beautiful and straightforward. Make
    sure to look for analytics integrations and see what reports your
    ESP offers before signing up.
5.  **Support.**  An ESP should be easy enough to use without any
    support, but there will be times when you need a hand. It's
    important to know that someone will be there for you.

If you want to build a massive email list, start with ExpressPigeon. We
host your list and make it easy to design and send emails that are
beautiful and mobile-friendly. You can [try ExpressPigeon for

## You Need To Send Amazing Emails

It goes without saying that in order to build an email list, you need to
send emails that people care about. Without awesome content, you can use
all of the list-building tactics in the world, but nobody will want your
emails. How can you develop great content?

1.  **Do the research.**  Subscribe to competitors to see what types of
    emails they send. Make a list of content categories and brainstorm
    the types of emails you want to send. Use competitor emails as
    inspiration but seek to create a program that is truly original.
2.  **Create an email content calendar.** Once you determine content
    categories, create an email content calendar with specific email
    topics and dates for delivery. Sending frequency should be
    consistent but test multiple delivery dates and times, content
    types, and designs to find what works best.
3.  **Design a branded email template.**  Use the ExpressPigeon email
    editor to design a beautiful template that reflects the look and
    feel of your brand - in minutes. You can easily replicate each
    newsletter and create variations for testing.

Here are a few email content tips to help you...

-   **Make emails easy to share.**  Add a "forward to a friend" link in
    seconds with [ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com). You can also
    add social sharing buttons using "tweet this" links from
    [ClickToTweet](http://clicktotweet.com/) or other social buttons.
-   **Share your best content.** Whether its your latest blog post or
    ebook, make sure to share your best performing content via email.
-   **Curate.**  Shine the spotlight on someone else. Promote content
    from industry leaders and let them know you will be sharing it in
    your newsletter.
-   **Ask your audience what they want.**  Instead of just trying to read
    the minds of your customers, ask them what they want. Who doesn’t
    want to have their voice heard or their questions answered?
-   **Tie in current events.**  Try to find ways to integrate important
    holidays and major events within your email content.
-   **Experiment with subject lines.**  Check out our post on [email
    marketing
    statistics](/blog/2014/01/06/email-marketing-statistics-2014/)
    to find a few subject line tricks that might work for you.
-   **Give extra value.** I'll cover this more extensively under the
    "Incentives" category in the deck below but the idea here is to run
    subscriber-only contests or give them something they can't get
    anywhere else.

*Once you have your email plan ready to go, it's time to start building
your list...*

## OPT-IN FORMS

1.  **Sidebar.** Add opt-in form to your sidebar.** **Add a subscription
    form to the sidebar of your blog with [this Wordpress
    plugin](?blog/2013/11/19/add-expresspigeon-subscription-form-to-wordpress-in-minutes/)
    or develop a custom opt-in form.
2.  **Hello Bar.**  Add a [Hello Bar](http://hellobar.com/) to the top of
    your website. You can encourage email signups directly in the Hello
    Bar or drive traffic to a subscription landing page.
3.  **Main Menu Page.**  Add an "Updates" or "Subscription" page to the
    main menu of your site. This should link to a page dedicated to your
    email subscription. Highlight the most important benefits of your
    email newsletter.
4.  **Custom.**  Create a custom opt-in form on your homepage. This is
    important if your primary goal is to convert visitors to email
    subscribers. Great for bloggers.
5.  **Popups.**  Annoy people with popups. There is
    [evidence](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/5-digit-email-lists/) to
    support that popups work but it's up to you to decide if the
    conversions are worth the interruptions.
6.  **Blog Footer.**  Create a custom opt-in form for the footer of your
    blog posts. See the bottom of this post for an example.
7.  **Opt-ins Everywhere.** Flood your site with opt-in forms. Ok, maybe
    not flooded, but consider adding an opt-in form to every page of
    your site. Visitors should always have an easy entry point.
8.  **Brilliant Copywriting.** Write amazing copy for your opt-in forms.
    Grab attention with the headline, nudge with the body, and trigger
    with the call-to-action. Communicate the incentives.
9.  **Something Extra.** Add something extra to your opt-in forms.
    Including a dollar value of your incentive or a testimonial or
    adding social proof can spice things up.
10. **The Simple Ask.** Don't ask for too much information before opt-in.
    Generally, all you want to ask for is an email address. The more you
    ask, the less visitors convert.
11. **Special Promotions.** Customize opt-in forms for special
    promotions. Are you anticipating a traffic surge from a new campaign
    or guest post? Tailor your forms to the guest audience.
12. **Optimization.** Optimize opt-in forms to improve conversion rates.
    Test small changes to your opt-in forms such as location, design,
    copy, call-to-action, and more. Something as small as changing the
    voice from first to third person can have a major impact.
13. **Interactive.** Develop a super unique opt-in form. Want to really
    stand out? Create an interactive signup form or video game that
    prompts signups. This can quickly turn into PR opportunities.

    most popular blog posts or choose a topic based on industry demand.
2.  **Email Course.**  Create an email course. This series of emails
    should educate your audience on an in-demand industry topic. Use
    autoresponders to schedule emails.
3.  **Webinars.** Run recurring webinars. Live video conferences can
    educate your audience and encourage them to sign up for emails.
4.  **Contests.** Run recurring giveaways or contests. Select a product

    email.
5.  **Special Club.** Create a club for subscribers. Brand your email
    subscription as a special club and offer a variety of incentives.
6.  **Audio Gift.** Record an audio. Take one of your ebooks or popular
    blog posts and record an audio version. Give this away as a free
    gift with a subscription.
7.  **Discount.** Offer a discount. Select a special deal or discount on
    a product or service for new email subscribers. Deliver the deal in
    the welcome email and set up a reminder email for subscribers who
    don't make a purchase.
8.  **Free Trial.** Offer a free trial. In exchange for an email and
    other information, give people an opportunity to try your product or
    service for free for a select time period.
9.  **Free Samples.** Offer free samples. Do you have product or services
    that you can afford to give away for free? Offer to send free
    samples to people who sign up for your emails.
10. **Video Gift.** Give people a valuable video. Create a screencast
    video for your audience and teach them how to do something
    important. Or create a tutorial video.
11. **Unique Tool.** Develop an online tool. Companies like Hubspot offer
    online tools that require an email subscription, whereas marketing
    leader Neil Patel, who [believes tools can be a better investment
    than
    content](http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/10/14/move-over-content-marketing-why-creating-tools-can-be-a-better-investment-than-creating-content/),
    offer tools for free without requiring subscription.

1.  **Confirmation Page.**  Create a custom email subscription
    confirmation page that welcomes new subscribers into your email
    community.
2.  **Gratitude.**  On the confirmation page, show gratitude to new
    subscribers by offering them a genuine thanks and links to free
    content they might find valuable.
3.  **SPAM Avoidance.**  On the same page, request subscribers to add your
    email address to their contact list to avoid SPAM filtering.

    social media links and encourage subscribers to share your
    subscription with friends.

    after they confirm subscription.
6.  **Welcome Email.**  Create a custom welcome email with ExpressPigeon
    that effectively delivers on the opt-in gifts you promised in your
    opt-in forms.

## JUMP-STARTING

1.  **Friends & Family.** Tell your friends and family about your email
    subscription. People closest to you are likely to help you in the
    beginning, and you never know who they know.
2.  **Reengagement.** Reengage your old email list. Send an email to
    subscribers from your old opt-in list inviting them to join your new
    one.
3.  **Old Contacts.** Send individual emails to old business contacts.
    Even if you haven't stayed in touch with all of your connections,
    they might be interested in your emails.
4.  **LinkedIn Connections.** Find connections on LinkedIn that work in
    industries relevant to your email subscription. Send each potential
    subscriber a unique private message.
5.  **LinkedIn Groups.** Introduce your email subscription to targeted
    LinkedIn Groups. You want to have a presence before promoting your
    emails so get active early.
6.  **Public Announcement.** Make a public announcement on all of your
    social media accounts to encourage your fans, followers, and
    connections to sign up for emails. Tailor the post to each audience.
7.  **In-House Promotion.** Develop a system for in-house promotion.
    Encourage your team, but do not require, to reach out to family &
    friends and promote your subscription on social media accounts.
8.  **Craigslist.** Promote your subscription on Craigslist with an ad
    that highlights the benefits of your subscription. This works best
    if building a list for a local event or product launch.
9.  **Email Signature.** Add a note and a link to your email subscription
    in your email signature. This gives everyone you email a chance to
    sign up.

## OFFLINE MARKETING

1.  **Paper Sheet.**  Add a paper sheet at your business where visitors
    can sign up. Make sure to highlight the incentives of subscribing
    and place the sheet where people can see it.
2.  **Conversation.**  Ask people to sign up for your emails in
    conversation. This works particularly well for B2B. After a meeting
    with a prospective client, tell them about your newsletter and ask
    them if they want you to add them.
3.  **Phone calls.**  Turn phone calls into subscribers. If someone calls
    you trying to pitch you on their business or you have a call with a
    prospect or customer, give them a chance to subscribe to your
    emails. It doesn't hurt to ask.
4.  **Signage.**  Use your outdoor or window signage to promote your
    emails. Let passerby know about the benefits of your emails and give
    them an easy URL or QR code to easily find your subscription form.
5.  **Print Materials Add-On.**  Promote your email subscription on all
    print materials. This works best when you offer irresistible opt-in
    incentives.
6.  **Dedicated Print Materials.**  Create postcards or other print
    materials dedicated to your email subscription. This works great if
    you have a special club for subscribers or run recurring contests.
7.  **Trade Shows Display.**  When you have a booth at a trade show, give
    people an opportunity to sign up for emails. A contest can be
    encouraging, but make sure people know what they are signing up for.
8.  **Hosting.**  Organize industry events. Put together a one-time or
    recurring Meetup, seminar, blogger dinner, or hackathon, and collect
    emails at each event.
9.  **Industry Events.**  Attend key industry events. Bring your email
    subscription print materials with you to the next event you go to.
    Beyond making connections, you might attract new subscribers.
10. **Direct Mail.**   Include email marketing in your direct mail
    campaigns. Request an email address or include a URL and QR code to
    your subscription page. Encourage direct mail recipients to go
    paperless.
11. **Phone Line.**   Does your business have a phone line? Replace that
    dreadful elevator music with recordings about your website and email
    sign up. Even your answering machine can help you get the word out!

## ADVERTISING

1.  **Website Advertising.**   Advertise your subscription on a site with
    similar audiences. Getting featured isn't easy, and advertising
    placement can get you powerful results.
2.  **Google Advertising.**   Run a Google AdWords campaign. Make sure you
    already offer compelling opt-in incentive and have a landing page
    for your subscription to direct ad clicks to.
3.  **Social Media Advertising.**   Run social media ads. Promote your
    email subscription on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, with highly
    targeted social advertising. Drive traffic to a subscription landing
    page.

## E-COMMERCE

1.  **Checkout.**   Place an opt-in form on your checkout page. Checkout is
    a great time to convert one-time customers into email subscribers.
    Offering a product discount on a future purchase is a great [opt-in
    incentive](http://blog.expresspigeon.com/2014/04/21/10-powerful-opt-in-incentives-that-will-get-you-more-email-subscribers/).
2.  **Email Receipts.**   Offer an opt-in option on email receipts. Some
    people are weary of subscribing during checkout, so make sure you
    reinforce your subscription benefits and offer an opt-in option
    directly in email receipts. This could be the reinforcement they
    need.
3.  **Abandoned Cart.**  Send abandoned cart emails. When someone leaves
    your site with products in their cart, it's important to send an
    email reminder. Once they come back and complete a purchase, they
    should have an option to subscribe for email on checkout and in
    their receipt.
4.  **Special Offer.**  Offer a product discount in exchange for
    subscription. This is a great incentive to encourage visitors to
    sign up for emails. Who wouldn't sign up for emails if it saves them
    10% on their first purchase?
5.  **Recurring Deals.**  Run recurring deals only available to email
    subscribers. Give people a reason to sign up for deals. This keeps
    retention up and gives visitors incentive to sign up.

## RETENTION

1.  **Goodbye?** Offer an option for subscribers to tell you why they are
    leaving when they unsubscribe. This helps gives you ideas on how to
    improve your campaigns.
2.  **Come Back!** After subscribers unsubscribe, give them an option to
    sign back up. This seems contradictory, but you'd be surprised at
    how quickly you can turn them around with a special deal or a funny
    photo.
3.  **See You Soon.**  When you have to take a break, whether it's for a
    vacation or family situation, let your audience know. This builds
    trust and makes sure they don't forget about you.
4.  **Inner Circle.**  Develop an inner circle. Do you have a few
    subscribers that seem to really love your emails? Give these fans an
    option to become a part of a more exclusive subscription and offer
    them special deals.
5.  **Spotlight.**  Feature subscribers. Ask your subscribers to offer
    their tips or ideas and feature a new subscriber in every issue.
    This gives subscribers an opportunity to become a part of your team,
    on a deeper level.
6.  **Suggestions?** Ask for suggestions. Don't be afraid to ask
    subscribers what they want to see or hear about in your emails. This
    can help you tailor your content before subscribers do that awful
    thing they should never do and unsubscribe!

TWITTER
-------

1.  **Check This Out.** Tweet a link to your subscription form and tell
    followers why they should sign up.
2.  **Coming Soon.** Tweet about upcoming deals or content available only
    to email subscribers. Tell your Twitter followers to sign up for
    emails to get access to the deal or content before you send your
    email.
3.  **Bio Link.** Include a link to your email subscription in your
    Twitter bio. Use a URL shortening service like bit.ly to avoid
    taking up too many characters.
4.  **Content.** Make sure you have opt-in forms on every page you link
    to on Twitter. When you promote a new blog post or eBook with a
    tweet, visitors should be able to easily subscribe.
5.  **Direct Messages.** Send a welcome direct message (DM) to new
    followers and include a link to your email subscription. Some people
    hate automated DMs, so consider personalizing them to each follower.
    You can also link to specific content that might interest them.
6.  **Email Tweet Links.** Include "tweet this" links in your emails. You
    can use a service like Click To Tweet to add links to your emails
    that encourage subscribers to share your emails on Twitter.
7.  **Embedded Tweets.** Include tweets in your emails. You can use
    content from Twitter in your newsletter, and when you do, reach out
    to those Twitter users and let them know that they were featured.
    You might want to request permission before using their tweets.
8.  **Incentive Promo.** Develop a Twitter campaign to promote one of
    your eBooks or email courses. As long as you have your opt-in
    process optimized, driving traffic to your content is always a great
    way to build your list.
9.  **Miss It?** Send a “did you miss our newsletter” tweet. No one
    enjoys feeling left out, especially if other people that follow him
    or her received something that they didn’t.
10. **Thank you.** Thank people or send retweets to people who are
    tweeting about your business, newsletter or emails. This adds
    exposure to those who may have missed your tweets about your emails.
11. **\#Hashtag.** Join discussions and mention your site. You can target
    your audience by observing hashtags and joining appropriate
    discussions. Once followers begin reading and retweeting, it’s
    easier to grab their interest in your newsletter signups.

FACEBOOK
--------

1.  **Subscription Tab.** Add a subscription tab to your Facebook page.
    Design a beautiful call-to-action image for the tab and link it to
    your subscription page. Or use [Facebook Email Sign
    Up](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/26330/How-to-Create-Custom-Tabs-for-Facebook-Business-Pages.aspx)
    to create one in minutes.
2.  **Content Tab.** Create tab for gated content in your Facebook page.
    You can build a custom tab that houses your free ebooks, email
    courses, or other content that requires email signup to access.
3.  **Contest.** Run a contest on Facebook that collects emails for
    entry. Learn how to do this in my recent post on [how to integrate
    email and social
    media](http://blog.expresspigeon.com/2014/03/19/how-to-integrate-social-media-email-marketing/).
4.  **Cover Talk.** Add a call-to-action in your Facebook page cover.
    Include a message that encourages people to sign up for emails in
    your cover.
5.  **Pay To Play.** Run a Facebook ad or create a promoted post that
    highlights your subscription.

SOCIAL MEDIA CONTINUED
----------------------

1.  **YouTube.** Promote your emails in YouTube videos. At the end of
    videos, encourage viewers to sign up for emails. Include an ending
    slide with a visible URL for your subscription page. In video
    descriptions, you can add a link to your subscription page or a
    piece of related content.
2.  **Google+.** Share your email subscription in a Google+ community.
    Just like LinkedIn Groups, Google+ communities
3.  **Vine + Instagram.** Create a short video for Instagram or Vine that
    tells people about the benefits to your emails. You can share your
    video on other social sites and embed it in a blog post.
4.  **Pinterest.** Promote on Pinterest. Create "Pins" that link to blog
    posts and especially content on your site that requires email
    signups, like eBooks or email courses.
5.  **Leaders.**  Learn from the best. Want to know how to use social
    media to better reach new eyeballs? Take a peek at what other
    prominent bloggers and other thought leaders are doing in your space
    to build their email audience via social.
6.  **Talk To Audience.** Engage your audience while you create your
    emails. When you're working on a newsletter design or content for
    your next send, don’t hesitate to tweet about why you like working
    on it and why you find it interesting.
7.  **Something New.**  Get out of your Twitter and Facebook comfort
    zone, and jump into the world of Google+ and Pinterest. The more
    platforms you’re on, the more opportunity you have to reach new
    users.
8.  **Follow Us.** Encourage users to follow you on different platforms.
    If someone already follows you on Twitter, give them an option to
    connect with you on Google+ or another channel and you build a
    deeper connection. The deeper the connection, the more the chances
    they have to find your content and eventually subscribe.
9.  **Become The Solution.** Were you hoping to find a way to integrate
    your social media with your email acquisition but found the options
    available lacking? Create a better way! There’s no better way to
    become an authority than creating the next great tool.
10. **Buttons.** Make your content easy to share on social media. Add
    social media buttons at the bottom or on the side of your blog posts
    and emails to encourage readers to share your content with one
    click.
11. **Content.**  Create posts that highlight specific incentives that
    you use to promote your email list. Promote each incentive
    separately on all social channels.

OTHER ONLINE TACTICS
--------------------

1.  **Guest Blogging.** Guest blog on industry sites that target an
    audience likely interested in your emails. Make sure to link to your
    email subscription page in your author bio. You can also link to
    your emails in the post, but only if it is genuinely relevant.
2.  **Partner Up!** Team up with a partner or affiliate site and run
    joint promotions. Hosting a webinar with a partner site or running a
    collaborative blog series can help you attract a valuable audience,
    or people who instantly trust you, to your site and your emails.
3.  **Blog Link.** Mention your email subscription in the context of your
    article. Try to tastefully slip in a [hyperlink to your email
    signup](https://expresspigeon.com/subscription/form/d8a9afc9-bab3-454a-a7e3-f0f84a45c6c5).
    It makes for a good article.
4.  **Industry Talk.** Engage on industry sites. Is there a blog that you
    read regularly? If you have true value to add, leave a comment.
    People will recognize your tips and click on you, finding your
    website, and eventually will find your email. Don't comment just to
    comment. There is enough noise already online.
5.  **Interviews.**  Unless someone wants to interview you for a site
    that goes against your beliefs, do the interview. Showcase your
    expertise and make sure to drop your URL and tell the audience about
    your emails. Embrace your inner celebrity! ;)
6.  **Outside The Box.** Contribute outside of your niche. Take your
    expertise to a leading site in another industry, create a guest post
    that benefits that audience, and watch your list grow. This is a
    great way to reach new markets and try new guest blogging tactics.
7.  **Start A Conversation.**  Content marketing expert Andy Crestodina
    wrote a [great article on how to start a conversation
    online](http://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/start-conversation-online/).
    A new connection can often lead to a new email subscriber, directly
    or indirectly.
8.  **Speak Up.**  Turn any interaction into an opportunity. Anytime
    someone engages with your site by posting a comment or doing
    anything interactive, try to get a prompt in front of them to get
    them on your email list.
9.  **Be The Answer.**  Actively seek out questions on discussion boards,
    like Quora, on topics related to your industry. Provide detailed,
    thorough responses for people. This establishes your expertise and
    will ultimately drive traffic to your site and help you grow your
    list.
10. **Get In Touch.**  Contact key targets in your industry. Don't be
    afraid to reach out to important thought leaders in your space via
    email or Twitter. Let them know about your emails and you might open
    up a world of cross promotion or add value to them and their
    business.
11. **Go Local.**  Don't sleep on locality. Look for prominent businesses
    and bloggers and news publications in your community. Reach out to
    them, and let them know about your emails. People are generally more
    likely to support other locals to help enrich the community.
12. **Clean It Up.**  Get rid of your website design clutter. When you
    give people too many options on your website, they often walk away
    and choose to do absolutely nothing. Clean up your website and watch
    your list grow!
13. **Patience.** Email marketing can be quite a bit like fishing. Just
    because something doesn’t take at first doesn’t mean you should
    completely abandon your fishing hole right away. Take the time to
    test out your ideas before moving on and trying a new one.
14. **Keep Learning.**  Never think you know it all as there is always
    something new coming on the horizon. Every list like this you read
    is merely capturing the best practices of internet marketing today.
