Customers sometimes ask:

> Why is the "Reply To" address sender@expresspigeon.com, and not the
> one I configured, and how to change it?

The answer is simple: Only the customer sees it that way. All actual
subscribers see campaign emails as coming from the customer. We do it to
avoid one of many spam filters ISPs put in to fight against spam. It
used to be a typical technique for spammers to send you an email and
pretend it is coming from you.
