    personalization, automated campaigns, and segmentation are the
    popular services provided by email service providers that marketers
    tap into.&nbsp;[tweet this](http://ctt.ec/m3f7f)
8.  Businesses are looking for deeper integration of email with other

1.  Nearly one third of email recipients open email based on subject
    line alone.&nbsp;[tweet this](http://ctt.ec/z9woa)
2.  Crazy subject lines generate opens but will damage subscriber
    relationships. If you use a subject line such as "Free booze", you
    better actually offer free booze. An exciting subject line that gets
    someone to open an email but leaves them with nothing special in
    return can have a negative effect on your business in the long-term.
    Why would a subscriber open your next email if they no longer trust
    you?&nbsp;[tweet this](http://ctt.ec/B50mW)

    boosts open and click-through rates.&nbsp;[tweet this](http://ctt.ec/8cUfk)

    click-through rates whereas "Monthly" hurts open rates and CTRs.&nbsp;[tweet this](http://ctt.ec/I2flu)
5.  Using the words "Sale" or "New" or "Video" in subject lines boost
    open and click-through rates.&nbsp;[tweet this](http://ctt.ec/bw94e)

**Takeaway**: *The key to higher opens and click-through rates is
consistency (daily or weekly), urgency (alert, news, bulletin), and
special offerings (sale, new, video). Don&apos;t get sucked into using crazy
subject lines unless they deliver as promised. Run [A/B Split Tests](blog.expresspigeon.com/2013/03/28/apples-vs-oranges-nah-email-ab-split-test/)
