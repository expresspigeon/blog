4.  **Adjust map size & formatting.** You can resize the map image like
    any other image by clicking and holding the bottom-right corner and
    moving your mouse NW to make smaller and SE to make larger. You can
    also left-align, center, or right-align your image and drag-and-drop
    to the desired location within the section. When you are happy with
    the size, position & location, click "Save' and you're done!
