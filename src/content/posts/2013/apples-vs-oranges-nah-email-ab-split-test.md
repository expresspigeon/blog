It is no secret that people scanning their inboxes only give 1 - 2 seconds
for each email to even consider if they want to open these
emails or trash them without opening. What does this mean to email
marketer?

*It means that you need to learn to write a winning subject.*

However, what does this mean? Even after  you gain some experience, and
you come up with several seemingly good options, how do you know which
one will get more emails opened? There is no such thing as equal
subjects! One will inevitably be better than another, but how do you
know which one?

The best way to do that is to... *not know*.  A/B Split Test email
campaigns have become an indispensable tool. It allows them to simply
come up with two subject lines, A and B, and then

*let the subscribers decide which subject gets more emails open*.

For example, when sending a campaign, you can choose A/B Split campaign

Campaign sending page above is
pretty self-explanatory. Add two best subjects you can come up with,
adjust the size of your test audience moving the slider left or right,
set the delay time and send!  
Our system will automatically select the best subject based on the open
rates after the time delay and will then send the rest of the emails
using the same winning subject.

Think of this as a subject competition. The one that wins, has a right
for survival :)

Happy marketing!
