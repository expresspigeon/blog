There's no better time to start email marketing than now. Email is an
incredibly powerful channel to help you build an audience and achieve
your long-term vision. Designing an email newsletter with ExpressPigeon
takes minutes but the journey to achieving your goals and dreams can
last a lifetime. Getting an early start with email marketing helps you
fail quickly, learn often, and take action to bring your vision to life.
So... where do you begin?

A great place to start is by

[signing up for the ExpressPigeon "Free For Life" email plan](https://expresspigeon.com/access/registration?plan=free).

For as long as you have 0-500 subscribers and send
fewer than 1000 emails per month, we won't charge you a penny. You will
have total access to all of our premium features, awesome integrations,
newsletter widgets, and you'll even have an opportunity to be featured
in our \#ExpressYourself campaign.

Whether you're a blogger, marketer, artist, small business, or just
someone crazy enough to pursue a dream, it takes time to find your voice
and commitment to build a following. It takes you having something
special to share with people who really appreciate what you have to say.
Email marketing is an ever-changing process, a constant experimentation
in relationship management. The only way to get better at it is to take
action. Start your journey [here](https://expresspigeon.com/access/registration?plan=free)
