Imagine that you are an organizer for a design conference called Design

#### 1. Create An Event Webpage in Eventbrite

Go to [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) and create an event webpage.
This is the home page for your event where you can sell tickets
and collect registrants.
Eventbrite makes it super intuitive and [easy to do this](https://www.eventbrite.com/features/).
They even offer a [Live Webinar](http://productdemo.eventbrite.com/)
to help you sell out your event.

ExpressPigeon automatically pulls information from your Eventbrite
account. You can now select the Eventbrite event that you want to insert
into your newsletter. All contacts from your Eventbrite event list are
automatically pulled into a new (or existing) email list on our account.
Accept the list and then click "Insert event and pull my
contacts".

![Insert Eventbrite event](/blog/images/2013/Screen-Shot-2013-10-09-at-6.46.44-PM.png "Insert Eventbrite event")

Once you click "Insert event and pull my
contacts", ExpressPigeon instantly inserts an Eventbrite link, event
information, and Google map image directly into your newsletter and a
new email list is created with all contacts from your event.

![Eventbrite integration ready](/blog/images/2013/Selection_999573.png "Eventbrite integration ready")

After the Eventbrite integration takes place, the newsletter editor
maintains the ability to make any stylistic or informational adjustments
as necessary. Edit the event section as any other section with text and
images - business as usual!

Now you are ready to send your event invitation! Please let us know if
you have any questions or comments. Happy marketing! :)
