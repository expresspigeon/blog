Our mission is to make your email marketing
experience as simple and powerful as possible. We are currently
developing [new widgets](expresspigeon-launches-email-newsletter-widgets)
and integrations every month and are super excited to announce that ExpressPigeon and Eventbrite
are now fully integrated. We are such good friends that you can pull event information
from Eventbrite directly into your newsletter with just a few clicks.

The process is simple: create an event webpage in Eventbrite, integrate
your accounts, then design &amp; send beautiful invitations from
ExpressPigeon.

Eventbrite makes it super intuitive and [easy to do this](https://www.eventbrite.com/features/).
They even offer a [Live Webinar](http://productdemo.eventbrite.com/)

ExpressPigeon automatically pulls information from your Eventbrite
account. You can now select the Eventbrite event that you want to insert
into your newsletter. All contacts from your Eventbrite event list are
automatically pulled into a new (or existing) email list on our account.
Accept the list and then click "Insert event and pull my
contacts".

Once you click "Insert event and pull my
contacts", ExpressPigeon instantly inserts an Eventbrite link, event
information, and Google map image directly into your newsletter and a
new email list is created with all contacts from your event.

After the Eventbrite integration takes place, the newsletter editor
maintains the ability to make any stylistic or informational adjustments
as necessary. Edit the event section as any other section with text and
images - business as usual!

Now you are ready to send your event invitation! Please let us know if
you have any questions or comments. Happy marketing! :)
