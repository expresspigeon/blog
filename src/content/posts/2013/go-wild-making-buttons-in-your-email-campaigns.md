Summary: Our Button Maker makes it fast and easy to create professional-looking
         buttons for your email newsletter without a tool like Photoshop. Making
         a Call to Action button is only a few clicks away.

Recently, a customer complained that her campaign did not generate any
clicks, while the open rate was healthy. After examining her newsletter,
we were surprised to the fact that there was not a single link included
the campaign!

*If you want clicks, you have to have links in your newsletter. :)*

A Call to Action is the most important part of email marketing, and
often people use images, simple Internet links (anchors) and buttons
(images that look like buttons). We have a number of buttons in our
gallery:

However, there are a couple of disadvantages to this approach. First, we
have to spend time making these. Second, they are implemented as images,
which means that people who disable images in their email will not see
our buttons.

This is why we created a Button Maker, and included it into our email
editor.

Our Button Maker makes it fast and easy to create professional-looking
buttons for your email newsletter without a tool like Photoshop. Making
a Call to Action button is only a few clicks away.

###How To Add Custom Buttons To Your Email Newsletter

2.  **Design & customize your button.** Customize the look and feel of
    your button to match your newsletter's aesthetics by selecting your
    button color, corners radius, font type, text size, and text color.
    Notice that as you add and remove button text, your button
    automatically changes size. When you're ready to insert your button,
    click "Save" and your button appears in the selected section
    location.

3.  **Make final edits.** Make final button text edits directly in the
    section editor and click the "Save" icon in the upper-left corner.
    You've now successfully developed a professional looking, 100%
    compatible call-to-action for your audience!

When creating a new button, customizations from the original button are
automatically saved with your newsletter, making it easy to duplicate
buttons and maintain design consistency.
