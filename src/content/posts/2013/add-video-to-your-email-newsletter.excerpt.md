Adding video to your email newsletter is one of the best ways to excite,
inspire, and engage your subscribers. We all love a good video!
Unfortunately, it's not possible to reliably embed a playable video into
a newsletter and people often [manually add a screenshot that links to a
video URL](http://blog.hostbaby.com/2013/03/how-to-add-video-to-your-email-newsletter/).Â 
We simplified the process with the ExpressPigeon Video
Widget, making it easy to add a YouTube video to your newsletter that
plays with just one click.
