a custom email subscription form creates an entry point for users to
opt-in to an email newsletter. This first step in email marketing is
especially easy to do on ExpressPigeon.

6.  **Select confirmation type.** Navigate to "After Submit". Select
    confirmation type. With "Single Opt-in", new subscribers are
    instantly added to your email list once they subscribe. With "Double
    Opt-in", subscribers must confirm subscription by clicking a link in
    a confirmation email. We recommend Double Opt-In.
