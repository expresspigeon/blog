We mentioned that there are thousands of different approaches to
designing effective welcome emails. We wanted to find and share some
great examples from moms doing big things on the Internet. We signed up
for hundreds of newsletters from modern moms, hoping to receive awesome
welcome emails. We were pleasantly inspired and learned some lessons
along the way.

##6 Lessons From Modern Moms That Will Transform Your Welcome Email

1.  **Get to the point, gracefully.** Stacy Makes Cents has one of my
    absolute favorite welcome emails. She sends a branded custom
    newsletter and delivers exactly what she promised, with a warm
    welcome message and the spark to get subscribers excited for future
    emails.

2.  **Be thorough and diverse.** Christian Mommy Blogger sends a
    thorough custom welcome email newsletter to welcome new subscribers
    into their vibrant blogging community. Want to know more about the
    newsletter? Want a detailed guide to grow your blog? Want to promote
    your own blog? Want to join a Twitter party? The CMB welcome email
    covers this and more, in a clean layout that makes it easy to read.

3.  **Keep it basic.** Some people elect to keep the welcome email
    extremely simple. Rather than sending a custom newsletter, Deb from
    Montessori Now sends a basic text email that gets right to the
    point. You receive links to download free content (as promised) and
    a simple "thanks". Just what you were)
4.  **Be exclusive.** Cool Mom Picks gets you excited to join "the
    coolest group of subscribers on the planet". They fill you in on
    what&apos;s to come next and remind you that they will respect your
    privacy. They give you an option to walk away (but why would you
    want to) and give you an email address to ensure that you have a way
    to get in direct contact. This is not just an email newsletter. It&apos;s
    an exclusive club. You are the newest member and CMP is so happy
    you&apos;re here.

5.  **Show a sense of community.** Nothing is better than feeling the
    comforting sense of community. Macaroni Kid sends a custom
    newsletter that has the feel of a personal email, excitedly
    welcoming you into the "Macaroni Kid family". The signature from
    Sara keeps the community feel with a "peace, love and macaroni". A
    nice touch to a strong welcome email.

6.  **Offer a special deal.** Moxie Jean skips the welcome email
    altogether by sending you to a welcome landing page after confirming
    subscription. They offer a time-sensitive discount code that entices
    subscribers to begin browsing the store immediately. A special deal
    is a great way to show immediate value (only subscribers get this
    deal) and encourage a website
    visit.
