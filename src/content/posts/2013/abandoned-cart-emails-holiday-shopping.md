The holiday shopping season is well underway and nothing screams holiday
spirit like \$7+ billion in online sales from Thanksgiving through Cyber
Monday ([comScore](http://www.comscore.com/)). Shoppers who elected to avoid kicking and
screaming went to their digital devices and racked up purchases that
brought online holiday sales up over 20% from last year.

E-retailers around the world launched extensive internet marketing
campaigns to tap into the holiday rush. Black Friday and Cyber Monday
came and went, but e-retailers have an especially important week ahead
of them. In fact, today marks the beginning of a four-day period that
historically accounts for more online revenue than Black Friday and
Cyber Monday combined ([Custora](https://www.custora.com/pulse)). So how do e-retailers capitalize on
this important week of business?

###Over 70% of your shoppers abandon their carts. Email them.

As incredible as it may seem, online shoppers leave nearly 3 of 4 carts
full without making a purchase ([Salecycle](http://www.salecycle.com/q3-cart-abandonment-stats/)). Nothing hurts more than
a broken promise, but for e-retailers, shoppers who abandon their carts
are ideal marketing targets. Sadly, very few companies are capitalizing
on this opportunity. According to the [Email Marketing Industry Census
2013](http://hosted.adestra.com/adestra/census/Email-Census-2013.pdf) from Econsultancy, companies get their highest ROI of any
automated email campaign with abandoned basket emails, yet only 20% of
companies are running them. The holiday season is an important time to
email your half-committed shoppers. But how do you set up abandoned cart
emails?

###How-To Send Abandoned Cart Emails

There are several ways to send abandoned cart emails. The best approach
is to integrate with ExpressPigeon so that your cart automatically
generates an email and sends it through our [Transactional Email
Service](https://expresspigeon.com/api#messages). Integration with our API usually takes less than a
day. Nonetheless, we understand that some marketing departments are
under stress and simply want a quick solution to...

*Send abandoned cart emails without any developer involvement.*

This is exactly where we can help. Since ExpressPigeon supports custom
fields, you can select emails of customers who abandoned their shopping
carts as well as links to their carts on your site. Having this
information means you are 20 minutes away from sending a re-engagement
campaign.

Simply load a list of your customers and their corresponding shopping
cart links, and fire away. Creating a sophisticated, branded newsletter
takes minutes with our powerful email designer and if you have any
questions regarding details or the entire procedure, simply [ask us](http://expresspigeon.com/support)

###5 Quick Tips to Send Abandoned Cart Emails That Convert

1.  **Don't waste any time.** The sooner you send an email to customers who abandon their carts, the
    more likely they are to complete their order. To automate abandoned
    cart emails, integrate with the ExpressPigeon [Transactional Email
    Service](https://expresspigeon.com/api#messages).
2.  **Be direct in your subject line.** Your email subject line should
    include your company name and a key product that was abandoned in
    the cart. Beating around the bush gets you nowhere. Example:
    Complete your order of (PRODUCT) at (STORE.com).
3.  **Leave a nice note.** Within your custom email design, write a 2-3
    sentence letter to your customers. Think of this part of your email
    as your hand-written note, telling your customers exactly why you're
    emailing them, how grateful you are that they visited your site, and
    how easy it is for them to complete their order.
4.  **Include a clear call-to-action.** Make sure that your design
    includes a large button that links directly to your customer's
    shopping cart. This is the most important call-to-action. Adding
    similar product recommendations can be nice, but don't distract from
    your main purpose.
5.  **Be easy to reach.** It should be easy for your customer to find an
    email address or phone number to reach you if they have any
    questions about completing the order. Make sure this is simple to
    find and large enough for your customers to read.

*We hope you find this post helpful for boosting your online sales this
holiday season. Happy holidays and happy marketing! :)*
