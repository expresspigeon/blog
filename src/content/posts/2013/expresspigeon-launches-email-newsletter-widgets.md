Summary: We are excited to introduce the incredibly helpful Widgets feature to
         the ExpressPigeon email newsletter design process. On our mission to
         help you easily connect and communicate with your audience, we found
         major obstacles to quickly and easily inserting videos, Google maps,
         countdown timers, and buttons into newsletters. To improve the process,
         we developed four custom widgets that should improve the user
         experience. Hope you enjoy!
