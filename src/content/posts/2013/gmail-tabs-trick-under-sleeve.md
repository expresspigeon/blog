There has been some hoopla in the blogosphere regarding new Gmail tabs
over the past few weeks, and I felt compelled to join the conversation.
I had a couple spare minutes over the weekend and fished this out of my
SPAM folder:

Yes, it&apos;s true, Google sent their own product email to my Google for
Apps SPAM folder! Something is up with their SPAM filter, but let me get
back to Gmail tabs.

Google built Gmail tabs to solve an important email problem: A
cluttered, unorganized inbox. The tabs feature automatically sorts
incoming emails into three tabs: Primary, Social, and Promotional.
Primary is dedicated to communication with actual people whereas Social
and Promotional are dedicated to emails from social sites and
subscriptions. It seems like a logical addition to the Gmail platform
but the change has marketers and small business owners showing signs of
concern, with some fearing “the death of email marketing” :)

### How might tabs hurt [email marketing](http://expresspigeon.com)?

*You are now “Promotional”*.

Gmail subscribers are finding nearly all emails from marketers and
subscription services in the Promotional tab.

*Open rates are down?*

Some companies are noticing a drop in open rates. We are not seeing a
significant open rate change for Gmail subscribers here at Express
Pigeon, but we&apos;ll keep our eyes on the numbers.

*The thrill is gone.*

Gmail subscribers no longer get distracted from their email process
with your awesome, catchy email titles. You are now two clicks away in a
boring Promotional tab.

####How might tabs help email marketing?

*Subscribers gain control.*

Eliminating distractions and organizing the inbox makes it easier for
Gmail subscribers to dedicate time specifically to reading email
newsletters. Choice vs. interruption means that subscribers should be
more focused on your email once they finally open it.

*Subscribers are less likely to unsubscribe.*

Gmail subscribers no longer need to delete or unsubscribe from
marketing emails because of a crowded inbox. They can easily access all
subscription emails in the Promotional tab, which should keep them from
getting annoyed by inbox interruptions.

*Marketers find new competition.*

You now compete directly with other marketers in the Promotional tab.
Competing with other marketers is easier than competing with friends,
family members, and business contacts in the Primary inbox.

#### Great... So how do I get in the Primary tab?

It&apos;s pretty simple. Ask your subscribers to place you there (drag and
drop).

#### So.. what about Mobile??

With more people accessing emails on the go, I wanted to understand how
Gmail tabs would be implemented on mobile devices. To learn more, I ran
an [email marketing](http://expresspigeon.com) test campaign and sent it to myself. I accessed
my email via the Gmail app from Google on my Samsung S3 phone. Please,
see results below:

*Social and Promotional tabs are grouped together on mobile and
displayed within Priority email list. (see above)*

**Bright colors** and clean buttons really
make the **Social** and
**Promotional** tabs stand out. As
you receive more personal emails, the tabs get pushed down. If you open
either tab, it disappears from the list and you have to slide all
folders from the left edge of your phone to retrieve them. However, once
you get a new email to your Social or Promotional inbox, the tabs
re-appear in your inbox!

*If anything, Gmail tabs makes promotional emails on mobile easier to
access than personal or transactional emails.*

####Does Gmail tabs really affect email marketing?

Email marketing is not just a “buy this now” cry. It is also great
advice to an interested crowd, timely transactional emails, email
marketing automation, etc – too much to list. Strong relationships and
great content will continue to win.

So.... to paraphrase Mark Twain, I&apos;d say that:

“The reports of email marketing death have been greatly exaggerated.”
