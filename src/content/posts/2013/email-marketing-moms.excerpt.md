Welcome to the Modern Mom Series, the official launch of the
[Better Email Project](/blog/2013/12/02/expresspigeon-better-email-project/).
This series is dedicated to sharing email marketing
wisdom, inspiration, and best practices from tech-savvy moms who balance
motherhood with the insanely difficult task of running a full-time
online blog/business.

I had the great pleasure of meeting some very inspiring mom
entrepreneurs and mom bloggers over the last few years, and in most
cases, I was absolutely blown away. Balancing motherhood with running a
full-time blog/business sounds impossible, but somehow, these moms are
doing it and doing it well.

Modern moms are some of the most creative, driven, and successful
bloggers and entrepreneurs in the world.
