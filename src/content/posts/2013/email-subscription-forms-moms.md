We scoured the internet to find moms who have especially awesome email
signup forms and we're excited to share our favorites! Whether you're a
blogger, entrepreneur, or marketing wiz I think you'll appreciate the
lessons we can learn from these inspiring email signup forms.

*Think your signup form is awesome? Leave a comment with a link and
we'll add it to the list if we agree. Hope you enjoy! :)*

**1. Sweet & hilarious.** via Patti from [Insane In The Mom Brain](http://www.insanemombrain.com/)

Lesson learned: Express yourself. Come up with something that really is
YOU. Patti says herself that she "ain't right in the head" but we
disagree. Her signup form shows us just how right in the head she must
be. It's short, sweet, and hilarious. And after reading her latest post,
it appears to be a true reflection of her voice. Don't believe me? [Read

**2. Clean & simple.** via Amy from [Mom Spark](http://momspark.net/).

Lesson learned: Don't overthink it. If maintaining your blog aesthetic
and spacing is very important to you, a simple subscription box in a key
location might be the move. Most new visitors want to know what they're
reading when they arrive at your blog, so placing your subscription form
near the "About" section of your sidebar is an easy way to draw
immediate attention. Amy beautifully spaces her social account links and
her newsletter signup right near her About blurb. Simple, clean, and
beautiful.

** 3. Original & incredible.** via Carley from [Carley K](http://carleyk.com/)

Lesson learned: Be creative and amazing. Come up with a way to do
something completely original, and do it well. Easier said than done,
right? It makes sense that Carley would have such an incredible sign-up
form. She specializes in "helping people play nice with technology". Her
signup form plays very nice with technology and psychology, with a
pop-up that doesn't feel invasive because it feels so personal and is
simply stunning. Sophisticated, clean, and original. It complements her
website perfectly. GET INSPIRED.

**4. Giving & respectful.** via [Living Montessori Now](http://livingmontessorinow.com/)

Lesson learned: Be generous. I don't know about you but I like free
stuff. I like it so much that I got really excited about this signup
form even though I am not, and never will be, a mom. Note: I am a man.
Anyways, I think the idea of giving away free eBooks is easy to do
(writing them is not), pretty brilliant and adding that little statement
about respecting privacy is quite comforting. When giving away something
for free, people might wonder what strings are attached. Thankfully,
none here!

**5. Specific & straightforward.** via [Stacy Makes Sense](http://www.stacymakescents.com/)

![ExpressPigeon](blog_images/2013/Screen-Shot-2013-10-21-at-9.29.18-AM.png "ExpressPigeon")

Lesson learned: Be honest. Tell your subscribers EXACTLY what they're
signing up for and everything they're opting into. Stacy from [Stacy
Makes Sense](http://www.stacymakescents.com/) does this brilliantly. She doesn't add a confirmation
email or any extra steps to the subscription process. Once you're signed
up, you immediately receive her eBook, as promised! What you see is what
you get. Even better, Stacy offers a valuable guide that strongly
supports her mission. :)

**6. Powerful & energized.** via [Cool Mom Picks.](http://coolmompicks.com/)

![ExpressPigeon](blog_images/2013/Screen-Shot-2013-10-23-at-12.17.44-PM.png "ExpressPigeon")

Lesson learned: Know your value! Popular mom site [Cool Mom Picks.](http://coolmompicks.com/) 
does this effortlessly... Well I'm sure it took some effort.
After all, they have a HUGE audience and developed relationships that
make it easy for them to offer huge value. What we can take away from
this is.. Everyone has SOMETHING valuable to offer. Figure out what it
is, and don't be afraid to share how awesome you are. Think, "All this
is yours". Pretty strong. Scary strong. You get it.
