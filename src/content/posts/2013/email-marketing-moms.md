Welcome to the Modern Mom Series, the official launch of the [Better Email Project](/blog/2013/12/02/expresspigeon-better-email-project/). This series is dedicated to sharing email marketing
wisdom, inspiration, and best practices from tech-savvy moms who balance
motherhood with the insanely difficult task of running a full-time
online blog/business.

I had the great pleasure of meeting some very inspiring mom
entrepreneurs and mom bloggers over the last few years, and in most
cases, I was absolutely blown away. Balancing motherhood with running a
full-time blog/business sounds impossible, but somehow, these moms are
doing it and doing it well.

Modern moms are some of the most creative, driven, and successful
bloggers and entrepreneurs in the world. We are hoping to share their
stories and best practices, in an effort to help you send better email
campaigns. Modern moms can teach us a great deal about email marketing.
We're learning a lot already, and we can't wait to share.

Thanks again for joining us for the Better Email Project. We're planning
to discover and share some amazing email marketing ideas along the way.
:)

**Modern moms...**

**1. are brilliant marketers.**  You don't just wake up one day and
find yourself with kids and a successful business. It takes something
special to get there.

**2. know their audiences.** Modern moms have this insane ability to
connect on a deep, personal level with their audiences. Exactly what we
need to do with email.

**3. make money.** Making money blogging is not easy, and neither is
making money with sending email. Modern moms know it's not easy, but
they do it anyways.

**4. often give away awesome stuff.** We are always looking for the
"right" way to give away free stuff. Doesn't everybody love free? :)

**5. compete with 4+ million modern moms.** To rise to the top of this
insane competition requires incredible confidence and individuality we
can all learn from.

**6. express themselves.** It's so important to be able to find your own
voice, and modern moms are so themselves, it's scary (sometimes). We can
certainly learn from this.

**7. are fearless.** Modern moms exude an extra "umph", a fire, that
gives them the confidence to be real and test out crazy marketing ideas.
Super important.

**8. are social.** Can you say Pinterest? Twitter? Facebook? Modern moms
are doing social HUGE and taking audience relationships to a whole new
level.

**9. are moms.** You wouldn't be reading this without them. Enough said.
