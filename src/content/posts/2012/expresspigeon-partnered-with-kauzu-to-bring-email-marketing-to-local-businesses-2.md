Couple of weeks ago I participated the media event [Kauzu Biz Has a True
Champion](http://www.kauzu.com/blog/2012/08/28/kauzu-biz-has-a-true-champion/) for the local businesses hosted
by [Patric O'Connor](http://www.aldermanoconnor.com/), the
Chicago Alderman of the 40th Ward. There were many representatives of
the Chicago Chambers of commerce, and turns out they are all sending
emails.  
I'm proud of the fact that ExpressPigeon partnered with [Kauzu](http://www.kauzu.com) to
bring advanced yet affordable [email marketing service](http://expresspigeon.com) to Chicago
Chambers of Commerce, as well as small businesses in their districts.  
It is a huge boon to our users here in Chicago considering that we are
here local and can provide a level service that cannot be rivaled.  
It is exciting to be part of a movement initiated by Kauzu to bring
more business activity to local Chicago businesses and be a catalyst of
a market rebound!
