One of the most important email marketing best practices is to write a
good subject line. After all, your subscribers have a short attention
span and will spend no more than 2 seconds to decide if they want to
open your email or send it to the trash. However, sometimes the limited
space of the subject isn't enough to entice your customer to open the
email: Enter the **Teaser Line**.

Once email providers recognized the subject wasn't enough information to
encourage opens, they augmented their software to display additional
content from the email.

The Express Pigeon email editor makes it really easy to add a teaser
line. Just click on the teaser box in the header, type your text, and
save.

Simple click on the teaser line, type in your text,
and save.

Here are some examples of how teasers lines look in an inbox:

The Teaser appears to the right of the subject and should entice your reader to open the newsletter.

The teaser is another opportunity for email marketers to be creative in
drawing readers into their emails. It's always smart to send a test
email to yourself to see how the subject and teaser flow before sending
your email.

**A Teaser Can**


* Make or break your reader from clicking on the email

If it's not enticing, or restates the subject, you're not making the
teaser work for you.


* Draw your reader in to your email

Some email clients block the big images in your email, but the teaser
will show up.


* Supplement the subject of your email

Make sure the teaser enhances the subject and leaves your reader wanting
more.

* Improve your open rate by giving just a little more info

**A Teaser Can't**

* Make up for bad content in the rest of the newsletter


Just because your teaser is enticing, doesn't mean you can slack on the
rest of the newsletter. Make sure to supply exciting content that keeps
the reader clicking.

* Lie to your readers

If your teaser promises something, like a “Buy One, Get One Free
coupon”, there better be a coupon waiting for your readers. Lying about
something is a quick way to get an “unsubscribe”.

* Have a misspelling

Yeah, first impressions matter. Don't look like the first kid sent home
in the spelling bee.

* Sound spammy

If it sounds spammy to an email server, your newsletter may never even
make it to the inbox. Do a quick search for "email spam trigger words".

Happy marketing, and go ahead, be a tease!
