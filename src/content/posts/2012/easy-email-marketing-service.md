Emails, emails, emails. We all get them, send them, need them and
sometimes even hate them. But why do we hate them? Maybe it's because
we're tired of the same boring old email templates and maybe we've even
learned to hate the process of creating them!

**STOP!!  (but keep reading on)**

It's time to let go of any preconceived notions of email marketing you
have from the past.

Look, we understand.   Maybe email marketing hasn't been an optimal way
for you to communicate in the past.  It has probably been a very
time-consuming process using programs that make you fight with clunky
visual “editors” all while trying to fit your content into a boring
"template".  Ugh!

As a business owner you know email marketing is one of the most
effective ways to reach your growing customer base. I mean really, who
has the time to find the best, easiest, cheapest and most useful email
service when you already have a job to manage! Plus, add that you're not
a computer science company!

Luckily, we have a solution where anyone can *easily* create
good-looking email ready to impress your following.
