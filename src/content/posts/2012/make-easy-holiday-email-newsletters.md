For most retailers, it is that time of year to consider marketing
and hiring plans to prepare for the upcoming gift-giving holiday season.
When making these plans, consider email marketing with [Express Pigeon
Email Marketing Service](http://expresspigeon.com) for a simple way to remind your subscribers
of all of the great products and services your business has to offer
during the busy holiday season.

Here are some tips by the [Express Pigeon Professional Services Team](https://expresspigeon.com/tour)
to help you prepare for a successful holiday email marketing plan.

**1. Prepare a Holiday Email Marketing Calendar**

Don't fall behind, prepare a holiday email marketing strategy and mark
all of the significant holiday shopping dates such as Black Friday,
Cyber Monday and the weekends prior to December 25. Preparing email
content for these busy times will help ensure your email marketing
strategy will not fall behind as the season progresses.

**2. Start planning your holiday newsletter content now**

Don't wait until early November to preparing holiday themed newsletters.
Better late than never but it is best to start preparing in late August
or early September.

**3. Write with the spirit of the season**

Creating holiday content while still wearing shorts in August can
sometimes not really put you in ‘tis the Season. Rely on all of those
wonderful holiday memories from years past and start writing as if
you're wrapping presents and sharing hot cocoa.

**4. Don't just focus on Christmas**

Thanksgiving, New Years Eve and Halloween can also be great times for a
boost in online sales, think of ways your business can profit from these
other winter holidays.

**5. Five Golden Rings!**

The holiday season brings holiday music that many love and cherish.
Share your favorite holiday playlist or let readers select a playlist
you can play to your employees. You can never have enough of *Grandma
Got Run Over By A Reindeer*!

**6. Prepare gift giving guides**

Guides and holiday shopping tips are always well received by readers and
can provide engaging content for readers to share via social networks
and forward by email.

**7. Utilize engaging photos and product videos**

Don't just use the stock photos of your products, think about taking
your own photos and creating your own review videos to share in your
newsletter. A serious, big-ticket buyer will often research many
retailers and videos can help garner their attention and maybe even help
draw an online sale.

**8. Engage your readers and customers**

Customers can be a wealth of great stories of holiday traditions gone
past. Think of all of the amazing stories of families going downtown to
see all of the Christmas lights and greetings with Santa. See if your
business can harness stories like these or think about how you can start
providing opportunities for customers to make new memories. Maybe the
memory is something they read every year in your Express Pigeon
newsletter!

**9. Help a holiday blogger**

Find holiday themed blogs and see how you can maybe help them increase
their readership. One link from your newsletter or website can go a long
way for a independent blogger!

**10. Prepare in-store signage and promote your holiday newsletter**

For businesses with traditional brick-and-mortar stores, think about how
you can integrate your newsletter in-store. Refer your customers to your
newsletter at point-of-sale or print a link to your subscribe page in
your weekly circular.

**11. Have a live blogger attend in-store events and shopping
promotions**

The chaos of mornings like Black Friday or the day after Christmas can
lend to some interesting content to share. Hire a blogger that will be
willing live blog certain in store events and make sure to capture these
moments and share in your newsletter.  Need expert blogging services,

**12. Share company and/or employee traditions through your newsletter**

Traditions make readers warm and fuzzy inside and your employees are
probably a wealth of holiday traditions and may even have some great
memories from working the past holiday seasons. Also, don't forget to
share photos of your Company's holiday party in your newsletter. (The PG
