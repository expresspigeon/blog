Have you ever thought to yourself:

> "hmm... these readers are opening my emails and engaging with my
> content. Maybe I should target some of them and personally follow up?"

Problem is, in the past, this was a very time intensive project.  - Not
any more!

Now, with [ExpressPigeon's](https://expresspigeon.com/) new Autoresponder feature, targeting
specific recipients is easier and faster than ever!  All while elevating

If you are a pro, you're probably already on your way over to your
account login...

If you are reading this and you're not exactly sure what an email
marketing autoresponder is, that's ok.  Here's a quick synopsis of this
email marketing tactic.

The very basics...

An autoresponder is a mechanism to automatically send emails based on
some type of user action. To make thing simple, let's call these actions
a "trigger".

##This diagram will help understand the process

Let's say you're running an online t-shirt store and as the store owner
you have decided to send out a newsletter featuring a new product line.
 The newsletter contains the following product options:

-   Product one is a male t-shirt
-   Product two is a female t-shirt
-   Product three is a kids t-shirt

To increase sales, you have decided to send a follow up email if a
reader clicks on the female t-shirt.  The "trigger" is being activated
by the link clicked to the female t-shirt product.

With the Express Pigeon autoresponder feature, we can simply break down
the list and send a follow-up email to our new segment of our main list
with just a few clicks.

##Here's how to setup an autoresponder

1.  Create an email newsletter or two for autoresponder, and if you
    created more than one, you can space them by time (3 days, a week,
    etc.)
2.  Tie this autoresponder to a specific product link.
3.  Create a standard newsletter with a few product links, and include
    the one you used to trigger the autoresponder in step 1.

After that, simply send the newsletter and sit back.

Whenever a customer of clicks on the product link, an autoresponder will
trigger an email  just to this particular customer.
