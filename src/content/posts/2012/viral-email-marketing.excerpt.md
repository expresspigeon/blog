The practice social media marketing is often about pushing content to a
following that will grab hold of the content with likes, and retweets.
The name of the game is to create engaging content that users will want
to share with their friends.

In this world of likes and tweets, digital marketers tend to steer
towards utilizing social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter,
LinkedIn and Google+ due to the social nature of the platform and the
ease for users to simply “share” with the click of a button.
