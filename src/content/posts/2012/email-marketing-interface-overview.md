####**Creating a Newsletter**


You can choose to create a newsletter from a template, from scratch or
upload your own custom HTML. When creating a newsletter from scratch you
will be able to choose a theme and format the layout with simple arrows.
These drag-and-drop arrows readjust columns quickly to fit the text you
way you want it - no more fighting with formatting.

**Rack Up Your Contacts**

Simply add your contacts to an email list from a spreadsheet or upload a
CSV file. You can even add people to the list individually. It's your
choice who goes on what lists. Divide your lists based on industry, B2B
vs. Consumer and so on.

**What's in a Campaign?**

Keep track of all of your email marketing campaigns. See what is in the
pipeline for future newsletters, what newsletters are currently in
progress, as well as those that have been completed.

**Why it's Beneficial to Create a [Web Form](creating-a-customized-opt-in-form-5-easy-steps)**

Don't let all the content you write for your newsletter each week,
month, etc. go to waste. Place an opt-in form on your website to gather
emails of individuals actually interested in what you have to say. This
is just one part of an excellent inbound marketing strategy.

The best way to get started with email marketing is to dive head first
and to experiment with design, content and format. Do some A/B tests.
Send out one format of the same newsletter to half of the list, and the
other format to the other half of the list. Review the click through
rate, and figure out if there is a correlation between click throughs
and the format.
