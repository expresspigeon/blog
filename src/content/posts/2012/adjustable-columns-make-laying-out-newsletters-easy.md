Creating a newsletter with multiple columns in [ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com) is a
snap.

With our intuitive email composer, users can simply drag-and-drop the
desired width of your two, three or four column block without using code
or changing templates. Best of all, there is no limit to the number of
column blocks users can add to a newsletter.

Here are some examples of Express Pigeon's one, two, three and four
column blocks.

Here is another example of the columned blocks but not in
uniform order:

With perfectly aligned blocks, users are free to add text, images or
other media and can watch the columns automatically adjust their height
as needed. User defined column widths allow for independently adjustable
content sections making for perfectly aligned sidebars and content
sections. Simply just add text and images.

To add a column block to a newsletter, simply select the Plus Menu icon
and then select the desired column block you wish to insert:

Once the block is inserted, it is easy to adjust the column width based
on your content and preferences.  Simply drag the vertical spacer to the
left or the right and the block's content will automatically adjust to
your needs.

The height of the column block will also adjust automatically.

If you want to adjust all of your column blocks to be a uniform size,
simply select the mark in the middle of the column spacer the
the adjacent column blocks will snap to make a uniform alignment.
