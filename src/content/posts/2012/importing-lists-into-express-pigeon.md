A major part of sending out emails through Express Pigeon is... having
people to send them to. Just as we crafted our state-of-the-art email
designer, we wanted to make importing email lists into Express Pigeon
just as simple and painless.

By listing simple
instructions, we'll show you step-by-step how to get started importing
your email contacts into [Express Pigeon](http://expresspigeon.com).

## Step one - create a list

In the dashboard, select the contacts
tab and create a new list – give the list a name and subject to keep
yourself organized.

## Step two - customize your list properties

You can customize your list properties  enter
your address information to ensure your emails are compliant
with the [CAN SPAM ACT](http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business/)
and our [Terms of Service](https://expresspigeon.com/terms). This information
is automatically pulled from your account information as a default.

## Step three uploading tour contacts

Now the important part – the actual uploading of addresses!
Navigate into “List Contacts” to begin.

### Manually type your contacts:

You could do it the old fashion way and manually type in all your subscribers if you have only a few:

### Upload a CSV file:

Another option is upload a CSV - Comma Separated Value - this is a
typical way to upload contacts into [ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com) account . To
do this, simply select Upload CSV and select a local file with your
contacts:

A CSV file is simply a text file with columns separated by commas.

If all you have is email addresses, then the file can contain a single
column of email addresses. If you have other values, such as first and
last names, addresses, etc. then  the file needs to reserve a first line
as a header

*Warning, some technical stuff:*   Headers can be in upper or lower case
and may contain any number of '-' or '\_' or spaces – but, if a header
is invalid it will be ignored with their respective columns. If you
don't have any headers, we will expect it to have a single column with
emails only. Here is [an example CSV file](/blog/resources/contacts.csv) which will help  you get
started. It contains all headers we support. Those headers that we do
not support will simply be ignored during import.

## Migrating from other Email Marketing Services:

If you had issues with your current email marketing provider, or decided
to try out [ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com), migration could be really easy because we
support native formats of many current email providers. Simply export
your contacts from your current provider and import it into your list as
a CSV file. Want to know if your provider is supported? Give us a shout
on our [Support](http://expresspigeon.com/support) page, and we will reply in a zippy!
