A major part of sending out emails through Express Pigeon is…. having
people to send them to. Just as we crafted our state-of-the-art email
designer, we wanted to make importing email lists into Express Pigeon
just as simple and painless.

We think we achieved our simplicity goals and by following these simple
instructions, we'll show you step-by-step how to get started importing
your email marketing contacts into [Express Pigeon](http://expresspigeon.com).

***Step one:***  In the Express Pigeon Dashboard, select the contacts
tab and create a new list – give the list a name and subject to keep
yourself organized.

***Step two:***you can customize your **List Properties**and** **enter
your address information so we can make sure your emails are compliant
with the [CAN SPAM ACT](http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business/) and our [Terms of Service](https://expresspigeon.com/terms). This information
is automatically pulled from your account information as a default.

Uploading Names and Lists:
--------------------------

Now, for the important part – the actual uploading of addresses!
Navigate into “List Contacts” to begin. You could do it the old fashion
way and manually type in all your subscribers

(we did say we have an option for everything!) – but who has time for
that?

Another option is upload a CSV - Comma Separated Value - this is a
typical way to upload contacts into [ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com) account . To
do this, simply select Upload CSV and select a local file with your
contacts:

Upload CSV file

A CSV file is simply a text file with lines separated by commas.

If all you have is email addresses, then the file can contain a single
column of email addresses. If you have other values, such as first and
last names, addresses, etc. then  the file needs to reserve a first line
as a header

*Warning, some technical stuff:*   Headers can be in upper or lower case
and may contain any number of '-' or '\_' or spaces – but, if a header
is invalid it will be ignored with their respective columns. If you
don't have any headers, we will expect it to have a single column with
emails only. Here is [an example CSV file](https://content.expresspigeon.com/3284/downloads/contacts.csv) which will help  you get
started. It contains all headers we support. Those headers that we do
not support will simply be ignored during import.

Migrating from other Email Marketing Services:
----------------------------------------------

If you had issues with your current email marketing provider, or decided
to try out [ExpressPigeon](http://expresspigeon.com), migration could be really easy because we
support native formats of many current email providers. Simply export
your contacts from your current provider and import it into your list as
a CSV file. Want to know if your provider is supported? Give us a shout
on our [Support](http://expresspigeon.com/support) page, and we will reply in a zippy!
