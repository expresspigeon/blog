"Don't put all of your eggs in one basket."

This quote reigns true for a successful marketing strategy. You can't
rely solely on your website, blog, social media platforms, or your
offline marketing approaches to reach your customers. You need all of
these components to work together. Your website should contain fresh
content. You should have a blog with informative posts that provide
solutions to problems. You should be active on social media platforms to
have your content shared by key influencers in your industry. Your
offline marketing should support your online initiatives. And lastly,
you need an email marketing program to reach those genuinely interested
in what your company has to offer.
