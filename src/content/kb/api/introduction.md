# Introduction
 
## Getting Started with the ExpressPigeon API

ExpressPigeon provides a set of API Endpoints to be used by external developers which allows for easy integration with our system.

Our API is represented by a set of [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) service end points. Common uses are covered, such as audience manipulation, replication and merge of templates, 
sending transactional emails, and others. We are constantly at work making our services better, and often make modifications and extend our APIs based on customer feedback. If you do not find what you are looking for, 
simply [let us know](/support), and will consider your request.
