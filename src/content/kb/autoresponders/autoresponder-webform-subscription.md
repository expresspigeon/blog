# Webform Subscription Triggers

Autoresponders triggered when a customer subscribes using a webform. They are great for gradually introducing your customers to your product.

## Configuration

Navigate to the _Autoresponders_ page and click 'Create new autoresponder' button and select 'webform submission' as your trigger. Please make sure you have at least one [webform subscription](webforms/regular-web-forms.md) created

Let check what options you can control:

* **Webform Submission** - A new webform submission will trigger this autoresponder.. Go to [this article](webforms/regular-web-forms.md) to read more about webform subscriptions.
* **Reply to** - Email to reply to. Subscribers will be sending email to this address if they click 'reply to' button.
* **From name** - Name of sender (your or your organization). Subscribers will see emails as coming from this name.
* **Enabled** - switcher that allows you to simply enable/disable autoresponder.
* **Rules** - allow you configure as many as you want autoresponder messages. 
    * Then wait for - amount of time you want us to wait before sending follow up email
    * Start with - your newsletter template you want to be sent
    * With Subject - follow up email subject


On the screenshot above, after someone submitted your webform subscription, we will wait for 2 hours and then send first autoresponder email with subject 'Thanks for joining us!'. After 1 more day second email will be automatically sent with subject 'Great opportunity'.
