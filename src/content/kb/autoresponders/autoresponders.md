# Autoresponders

An autoresponder is a mechanism to automatically send emails based on some type of user action. 
To make things simple, let's call these actions _triggers_. 

Currently we provide following types of triggers:

* [Link Click](autoresponder-link-click)
* [WebForm Subscription](autoresponder-webform-subscription)
* [Facebook Subscription](autoresponder-facebook-subscription)
* [API trigger](autoresponder-api-trigger)

## Autoresponders Actions

When you configure autoresponders, you can:

* View reports for each autoresponder
* Edit an autoresponder's details
* Delete autoresponders
* Enable/disable autoresponders
