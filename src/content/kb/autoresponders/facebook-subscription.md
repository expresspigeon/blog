## Facebook Subscription Autoresponders

Autoresponders start when a customer subscribes using a Facebook subscription form. They are great for gradually introducing your customers to your product.

### Create Autoresponder with Facebook subscription trigger

Before you start, please make sure you have at least one [Facebook subscription](webforms/fb-subscriptions.md) created.
Go to Autoresponders page and click 'Create new autoresponder' button. Please note that if you don't have any autoresponders, you will need to enter Autoresponder name and trigger before you can proceed:
