# Unsubscribe Links

The CAN/SPAM act requires unsubscribe links in all bulk emails, and requires that any person who chooses to unsubscribe be 
removed from the list within 10 days. ExpressPigeon removes all unsubscribes immediately. 
Transactional messages do not require unsubscribe links as they are considered important system updates.

## Location of Unsubscribe Links

When creating a newsletter, the unsubscribe link will be present in the header, as well as, the footer. The unsubscribe link in the 
header can be disabled (as shown below), but do to CAN/SPAM the unsubscribe link in the footer cannot. 
ExpressPigeon recommends making unsubscribing as easy as possible by keeping both which will ultimately have a positive impact on 
deliverability.
