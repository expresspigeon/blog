##ExpressPigeon Automation

*picture of a robust flow in EP

Automation in ExpressPigeon is a capability that allows non technical people to define
highly technical workflows in a non visual manner. Like anything else we do at ExpressPigeon
we have added extremely complex capabilites and made them easy to use. 


##Flows

ExpressPigeon uses flows to execute processes. Flows are made up of three types of elements, 
triggers, actions, and conditions.

###Triggers

A trigger is an event that starts a flow process for a specific contact. Examples of triggered
flow processes are:
*Put a contact on a schedule to run an entire list
*Contact added to list
*Contact subscribed through a web from
*API, trigger a flow for a contact using API

###Conditions

Conditions represent forks in the business flow that closely resemble the conditional rules for 
segmentation, only more powerful. There are additional rules in flow conditions that allow
you to process based on customer behavior within the same flow.

Conditions on the flow chart are represented by diamond shapes. Conditions are connected
to Actions, which are outcomes.

###Actions

Actions are commands that our system will execute at a specific time based on conditions.
Our system has the following actions: 

*Send a transactional message
*Raise a Zapier trigger
*Move a contact to a target list
*Copy a contact to a target list
*Time delay
*Negative time delay
