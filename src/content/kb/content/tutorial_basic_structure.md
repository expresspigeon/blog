## Rows & Columns

When creating a newsletter from scratch youâ€™ll see a highlighted row from which you can choose the number of columns
in your row as well as the type of content for each block (text, photo, etc.)

## Text Editor

From the text editor beneath your highlighted block you can edit text, formatting, headers, links, buttons
and even add custom personalizations.
