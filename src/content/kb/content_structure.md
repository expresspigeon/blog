## Row Content
 
The editor is structured by rows with one to four content blocks. If a block is selected, youâ€™ll see the row edit menu above.
When you click on a specific block you will also see a corresponding edit menu below, which will vary based on the content of the row.
 
## Content Blocks
 
Easily resize blocks by dragging to the desired size. Align content using the padding control in the properties panel to adjust
spacing within the block.
