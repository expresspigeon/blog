When you set content type as Button, the "Create button" window will open. You can label your button here, 
as well as set custom "Button link" or select a predefined link from a list:

* Unsubscribe (will unsubscribe the contact from the account)
* View online (will display the message in browser)
* Confirm subscription (will confirm a subscription from a web form)
