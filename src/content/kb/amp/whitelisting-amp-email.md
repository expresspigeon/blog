# Thank you!

Thank you for registering to receive dynamic  messages from ExpressPigeon!

Please, follow [Whitelisting instructions](#whitelisting-instructions) to configure your
inbox.   

## Introduction

This page is intended for a limited audience of internal IMImobile staff interested in 
ongoing work around APM implementation at ExpressPigeon.

The main goal is to experiment with AMP features and build and build tooling to help marketers 
author professional dynamic messages without knowing how  to code. 

## Limitations

* Google is the only US-based inbox provider  that supports AMP email
* Google requires a  sender-approval process for allowing dynamic messages to display in Gmail inboxes. 
* Google provides a way to test dynamic messages without the approval process if the sender email address 
is whitelisted in the recipient Gmail settings. 

Google requires a process of approval for all senders  of AMP messages, which takes some effort and time. 
However, we can omit this process and  simply whitelist the sender email address for dynamic emails.


Please, follow the steps below to whitelist `blogger@expresspigeon.com` email address as a 
sender of dynamic  messages to your inbox.
