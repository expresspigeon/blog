# Facebook Subscription Button 

A Facebook subscription button placed on your site will allow subscribers to signup to your list with a single click. 
When a visitor clicks this button on your site, we will pull their email address from their Facebook account, 
 it is that simple! They do not have to even type their email address.  


### Building a Facebook button
