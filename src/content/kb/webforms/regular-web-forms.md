### After submit

- **Select confirmation type**

Navigate to "After Submit". Select confirmation type. With "Single Opt-in", new subscribers are instantly added to your email list once they subscribe. With "Double Opt-in", subscribers must confirm subscription by clicking a link in a confirmation email. We recommend Double Opt-In.
