# Build a Custom Email Subscription Form in Minutes

A webform or a subscription form is used to collect email addresses of visitors on your site. A good subscription form is essential to growing your email list. 

Building a custom subscription form creates an entry point for users to opt-in to an email newsletter. 

## Building an Subscription Form

The "After submit tab" is a place where you can configure  what happens when your subscribers 
 submit a confirmation form. This includes: 
  
* A response message
* Double Opt-in message should you decide to use it 
 

### Form Submit Feedback

When a subscriber submits a form, they will see a "Thank you" message. You can chose this message
to be hosted on our site, or on yours. 


### Feedback Type 

In order to host it on our site, select a "Message" option and edit the content of this page:

### Opt-in Confirmation Email

If you chose the Double Opt-in confirmation for you form, you will be able to configure a standard message or a custom one 
based on your newsletter design. 

The standard message can still be configured:

If you want to maintain your brand and design, simply create a newsletter for subscription confirmation using 
[our editor](/kb/creating-and-editing-newsletter) and chose your custom template for the confirmation. 

> The title of the template in our editor will be the subject for the confirmation email.

> Ensure that the confirmation newsletter will have this merge tag in it: **${confirm_link}**. 
It serves as a placeholder for insertion of a dynamic confirmation link. 


### Single Opt-in

If you select Single Opt-in, we will not be sending a confirmation email and your subscribers will be placed on a list
instantly. 

> We recommend double opt-ins. 
 

## Confirmation Tab

This is what is displayed for a subscriber after confirming from a Double Opt-in message. 

Here you again can configure a message hosted on our site, or redirect to yours.
