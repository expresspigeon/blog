# Integrating Recaptcha into HTML form

A [ReCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html) is a technology from Google that allows you to protect your forms from 
hacking.  

If you are hosting a subscription form on our site (by clicking the View Online button or using the iFrame), nothing needs to be done, 
since we are integrating ReCaptcha automatically.

In case you want to integrate HTML code into your website directly, follow these steps:

## 1.  Send Request to Support

Send a request to our [Support](https://expresspigeon.com/suport) to request ReCaptcha enabled on  your account.


## 2.  Register your site with ReCaptcha

If you have not already done so, register your site on  [Google ReCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/) site. 


## 3. Configure ReCaptcha Keys

Once previous steps are complete, you can copy the Site and the Secret Keys to the Integrations page in 
your ExpressPigeon Account. Just copy these from Google:

into your [ExpressPigeon Integrations Page](https://expresspigeon.com/settings/integrations):

At this  point, your HTML forms will be generated complete with proper ReCaptcha keys.
