# Adding a row

You can add another row by either clicking the **+** in the Row Editor or by clicking _Add new row_ in the Row Properties Panel on the left. 
From the Row Properties Panel, new rows will be added to the top of the newsletter. 
From the Row Menu they will be immediately added above the current row.
