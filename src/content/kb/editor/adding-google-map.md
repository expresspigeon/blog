# Adding a Google Map

Embedding Google Maps into your templates/newsletters gives your contacts clear directions to your
 event or a physical location. The resulting image will contain a link to Google Maps, which they can use 
 for navigation. 
 

## How to Add a Google Map

You can add a map by setting content type to Map. When the _Insert Google Map_ window opens simply type in the address and 
click the Create button. Your map will be inserted into the chosen block.
