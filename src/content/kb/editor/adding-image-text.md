# Adding Image/Text Blocks

## The problem: 
  
Normally, the blocks would fall under one another on a mobile device, so if you have 
 a line of images and a second line of text descriptions for these images (typical for product display), then
 on a mobile device, the descriptions will separate from images. 
 
## Solution: 

Image/Text is a special type of content in our editor which allows you 
to tie text and image together so that they do not separate on responsive devices. 
 

When you set the content type as Image/Text, the selected block will populate with two items. On the left you will be able to open 
the Gallery as outlined [here](adding-image). On the right you'll be able to click to add text as 
outlined [here](adding-text-blocks).
