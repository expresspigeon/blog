# Language support

We support your language! 

## Unsubscribe/View online

In the Template Properties panel you can set the language for your Unsubscribe/View Online links.
This not only changes the language of the visible links, but also the entire unsubscribe flow.
 
> If a recipient gets an email with a Chinese unsubscribe link and clicks it, the recipient will then be taken to an 
ExpressPigeon page which will tell them, in Chinese, that theyâ€™ve unsubscribed.
