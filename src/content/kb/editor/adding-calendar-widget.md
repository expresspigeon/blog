# Countdown Calendar

Our Calendar Widget will display _exact time left leading up to your event_ dynamically for each person 
depending on when the message was opened... even if it was opened multiple times. 
 
> Use it to create a sense of urgency for your event.

## How to Add a Countdown Calendar

Set the content type as _Calendar_ which will open the _Insert Calendar countdown_ window. 
Select the countdown type on the left, the date/time on the right, hit the _Create_ button, 
and your countdown will insert into the selected block.
