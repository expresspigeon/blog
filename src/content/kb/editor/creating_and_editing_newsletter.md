You can add another row by either clicking the **+** in the "Row Editor" or by clicking "Add new row" button in the "Row Properties" panel on the left. 
From the "Row Properties" panel, new rows will be added to the top of the newsletter.

When you click on a specific block you will also see a corresponding edit menu below, which will vary based on the content of the row.
