# Template Tags

When you are overwhelmed with your templates and want to organize better, you can assign tags to templates. 
Once you have done that,  you can search templates not only by names, but also by tags.  


## Adding Tags to the Templates

When a template is open in the editor, you can find a tagging component in the left lower corner of the page. 
Just start typing your tag. If the tag exists, it will show up in the auto-suggest list. If it does not, somply press Enter, and a new tag 
will be created on the fly.

## Searching by Tags

When you open a search widget, and want to search by tags in addition to a name, click the Advanced link:

This will open two search fields: by name, and  by tag. As you start typing tag names, 
the system will auto-suggest existing tag names for your convenience.

## Managing Tags

Tags are stored on your account and can be managed in the "Settings" area. You can always access it by a direct link: 
[Tags](/settings/tags).

Use this page for edit or deleting of existing tags. Adding new tags can be done from within the editor, as described above.
