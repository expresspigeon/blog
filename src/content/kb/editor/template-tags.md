# Adding Buttons

There are two ways to add buttons:

* Adding a button as a content block
* Embedding a button into a Text block

## Button as a Content Block

When you set the content type as Button, the "Create button" window will open. 
You can label your button here and set a link as a Call-To-Action. 

> If you'd like for your button to send an email use "mailto:" followed immediately by the email you 
want to send to.

As an alternative, you can select one of the pre-defined links:

* Unsubscribe (will unsubscribe the contact from the account)
* View online (will display the message in browser)
* Confirm subscription (will confirm a subscription from a web form)

Once the button block is added to your template, you can edit its properties:

## Embedding into Text Block

If you want to insert a button directly into a Text block, use the button in the   
text editing menu.

Once you click to insert a button into text, the dialog below will open. 

You have the opportunity to set the link, text and other properties for a button.

> When embedding a button to a text block, you can only edit its properties while inserting.
> If a button is added as a standalone content block, you can edit its properties at any time.
