# Content Blocks


Our [Email Composer/Editor](/kb#email-editor)  contains an ability to create 
a repository of reusable content blocks. A Reusable Content Block is usuially a 
row of content from any template that can be used in any other template. 
Examples can be: social links, legal disclaimers, common corporate headers and footers, etc. 


## Create new Content Blocks


If you want to save a row of content into a Content Gallery, click the "Add to Gallery" button:

and  provide a name for this block:

> NOTE: Content Blocks can be edited after inserting  onto a  template. This does not affect the 
Content Block in the Content Gallery.



## Inserting Content Blocks into Templates

In order to view and insert Content Blocks into templates, click the Content Gallery 
button and find a corresponding Content Block:

The mouse hover over a Content Block exposes control buttons to insert a content block into a current template 
or delete it.
