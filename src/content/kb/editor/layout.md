Want to see this in action, follow on to [Basic structure](/kb/editor_creating_and_editing_newsletter#basic-structure)
video clip.



## Newsletter Header

The Header contains three elements:

* [Teaser](https://expresspigeon.com/blog/2012/12/14/increase-email-open-rates-with-a-teaser-line)
* [Unsubscribe link](#unsubscribe-links)
* [View online link](#view-online-link)

Clicking on the Header will make the Header Properties panel display on the left. You can set the
Teaser and toggle the links in the properties panel.

### Unsubscribe Links

The CAN/SPAM act requires unsubscribe links in all bulk messages, and also requires that be
removal from mailing within 10 business days. We suppress all unsubscribes immediately.
Transactional messages do not require unsubscribe links as they are considered important system updates.

### View Online Link

The View Online link allows the user to display the email in a web browser in the event that there is a problem with their email client.
Everything in the browser view will display exactly as you would see it in the editor. The View Online link can be toggled
on and off in the editor. It is recommended that you have it turned on.


> The View Online link will not work for test emails sent with a Quick Send button


## Newsletter Footer


The Footer contains your address which is a requirement per the CAN/SPAM act.
The address in the footer should reflect the actual physical address of the sender.

### Physical Address in the Footer

Addresses are list-specific and can be changed under _Contacts_ by clicking _Properties_ on the desired list,
then clicking _Physical Address_ from the left column on that screen.

> When sending, the address of the target list is used, regardless which address is displayed in a footer
during editing. You can provide different addresses per each list. Editing the address on the account settings
 has no effect on list addresses.

### Unsubscribe Link

The unsubscibe link in the footer can not be removed  in order to comply with CAN SPAM Act.
If you have a *very* good reason to remove it,
please send us a [support request](https://expresspgieon.com/support).


## Location of Unsubscribe Links

When creating a newsletter, the unsubscribe link will be present in the Header, as well as the [Footer](#footer). The unsubscribe link in the
header can be disabled (as shown below), but due to CAN/SPAM  Act the unsubscribe link in the footer cannot be removed.
ExpressPigeon recommends making unsubscribing as easy as possible by keeping both which will ultimately have a positive impact on deliverability.

If you maintain your own preferences page and really want to remove the ExpressPigeon unsubscribe link from newsletters,
 please request it from [Our Support](https://expresspigoen.com/support).


## Row Menu


When a contnet block is selected (by clivking into it), the Row Menu  will display just above  it. Using it, you can:

* Move internal content blocks left and right
* Drag entire row up and down
* Add another empty row just above the current one
* Make a copy of the current row
* Delete the row

Follow to [Moving content](/kb/editor_creating_and_editing_newsletter#moving-content) to learn how to move content
around.

## Global and Local Styles

Within the editor you can set Global Styles that affect the whole newsletter as well as Local Styles for individual blocks.

> Local Styles always override Global Styles.

### Global Styles

The Newsletter tab in the Properties Panel contains a Global Style Editor. Here you can set standards for the entire newsletter
as well as things like background color, background image, etc.

> If you set styles for Header 1 or Header 2 in the Global style editor, they will apply to all respective headers across the newsletter.
Same goes for text and links.

### Local Styles

The Local Editor is displays directly underneath a currently edited content block, where you can make edits to your content.

## Setting the Language

If you send to the international crowd, you can set the language for your Unsubscribe/View Online links.
This not only changes the language of the visible links, but also the entire unsubscribe flow.

> If a recipient gets an email with a Chinese unsubscribe link and clicks it, the recipient will then be taken to an ExpressPigeon
unsubscribe page which will tell them, in Chinese, that theyâ€™ve unsubscribed.


Currently we support about 60 languages.
