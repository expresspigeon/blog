# Google Analytics 

Our platform has a direct integration with Google Analytics that helps  you 
track your website traffic as it is coming from your email campaigns. 

Normally, the Google Analytics are setup manuall, as  described on the 
[Google URL parameter](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6277564?hl=en) page. 

When you send a campaign from our platform all you have to do is check 
the Google Analytics check box:

When sending a campaign with Google Analytics turned on, we will tag every
link in your newsletter with Google Analytics values:

* utm_source=ExpressPigeon
* utm_medium=email
* utm_campaign=[your campaign name]

This way you can use your Google Analytics dashboard to track traffic on 
your site as it pertains to a specific email campaign from our platform.

The `utm_source` and `utm_medium` values are pre-set, but the campaign name
responds to a campaign name  you provide.
