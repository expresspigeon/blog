# Eventbrite

Eventbrite integration allows you to create custom branded messages
to be sent to the attendees of your event. 

First you need to connect your ExpressPigeon and Eventbrite accounts. 
Please navigate to the [Integrations](https://expresspigeon.com/settings/integrations) page and
press Connect Eventbrite account button. Follow the prompts and allow ExpressPigeon 
to access your Eventbrite account.

The 'Select event' dropdown will pull down all of the events in your Eventbrite
account so that you can choose which event to add to your template.

The "List name for contacts' is a suggested name for a list where attendees 
 will be inserted. In other words, we will pull the entire content of your 
 event and all attendees with one click of a button. The contacts will be 
 inserted into a corresponding list while event content will be added to the
 template.
 
 > If a list with this name already exists, the new attendees will be added to it.
 If it does not, a new list will be created on the fly.
