#Global and Local Styles

Within the editor you can set Global Styles that affect the whole newsletter as well as Local Styles for individual blocks. 
Local Styles always override Global Styles.

## Global Styles

The Newsletter tab in the Row Properties Panel is essentially a global editor. Here you can set standards for the entire newsletter
as well as things like background color, background picture, etc. 

## Local Styles

Youâ€™ll find the Local Editor directly beneath a currently active row. Here you can make edits to specific blocks without affecting the 
entire newsletter.
