# IP Whitelabeling 

IP Whitelabeling is a process of tying a sending  domain to a sending IP address.
There are three email technology standards that make help ISPs relate sending domains 
and sending IP addresses: SPF, DKIM and PTR 
 
 
> A sending domain is a part of the "Reply to" email address

For instance, if you are sending from `john@example.com`, then the sending domain is 
`example.com`.
 
## "VIA" and other warnings
 
In a typical scenario, our customer would use their sending domain, but the messages will be 
delivered from our IP addresses, and our domains associated with those IP addresses. 
Our typical domain would look like: `smtp0021.epmailer.net`. When an ISP received such a message, 
they quickly figure out  that your sending domain and our domain associated with the sending IP are not the same. 

When this happens, different ISPs will display a warning. For instance, Gmail will display a so-called "via" message.

The point of this message is  this: the **sending domain** is `venturepulse.org`, but the email came from IP address 
 associated with domain `cmail.com`.

## DKIM

You can read our article [DKIM in plain English](https://expresspigeon.com/blog/2012/04/18/dkim-in-plain-english-and-a-few-internet-terms)
to learn more about DKIM.

## SPF

The SPF article [SPF in plain English](https://expresspigeon.com/blog/2012/01/18/spf-in-plain-english-and-a-few-internet-terms)
 will help you learn about SPF
 
## PTR

The PTR is also known as [Reverse DNS Lookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup). 
It is a mechanism that allows ISPs to lookup a domain associated with an IP address 
(as opposed to looking up the IP address for a domain, hence the "reverse" lookup).

Normally other ESPs are offering DKIM and SPF configuration. We provide the PTR configuration on demand. 
 Let us know on our [Support line](https://expresspigeon.com/support) if you'd like to get a PTR configured for your domain. 
 
## How to whitelabel our IPs

Our service includes configuration of DKIM, SPF and also PTR for better deliverability. 

In order to whitelabel our IPs for your sending domain, please add the following configuration to the DNS records 
if your sending domain: 


 
1. Add a TXT Record (SPF Configuration)
 
Add the following to your existing SPF record: `include:spf.epmailer.net`. 
 
The SPF record needs to look like:
 
```
TXT @ "v=spf1 include:spf.epmailer.net ~all"
```

where `@` is a name and `v=spf1 include:spf.epmailer.net ~all` is a value. 


> If you have an existing SPF record, do not add a second one! SPF standard allows only one record. 
 Adding a second one will break the first one. 
 
2. Add CNAME records:
 
```
CNAME  k1._domainkey        dkim.epmailer.net
CNAME  ppdkim._domainkey    ppdkim.epmailer.net
CNAME  delivery             delivery.epmailer.net 
```    

3. Request a test  and approval of your new configuration by sending us 
a support request: [Support line](https://expresspigeon.com/support)
