# Setting the Language

![](images/Selection_472.png)

In the Row Properties Panel you can set the language for your Unsubscribe/View Online links. 
This not only changes the language of the visible links, but also the entire unsubscribe flow. 
If a recipient gets an email with a Chinese unsubscribe link and clicks it, the recipient will then be taken to an ExpressPigeon 
unsubscribe page which will tell them, in Chinese, that theyâ€™ve unsubscribed.
