# Segments


Our Segments are a set of rules defined by you for selecting contacts from your lists. When a segment is executed it will select and add contacts from a list and will add them to a new or existing list. 

Please, see below that you can combine your contact properties into OR and AND blocks. We have no limit on number of conditions.

## Creation of Segments

One way to view and create segments for a list from the All Lists page:

A second navigation method is from a List view itself:

## Creation of a New Segment

To create a new segment, navigate to the Segments page for a list.
If you don't have any configured segments for this list, you will see a form for creating a new segment:

## Editing Rules

Once you have created a segment, you can define the rules for extracting people from this list.

'Rule Set' fields are based on: 
 
* standard fields - they come out of the box
* custom - you can define these on your account 
* engagement - open and click events

The following conditions are available for each field: 

* is
* is not
* exists
* does not exist
* contains
* does not contain
* starts with
* does not start with
* ends with
* does not end with

For fields with type *date*, you can see:

* on date
* before
* after

Also you can use **or** operator within your Rule Set. Additionally, you create multiple Rule Sets and 
 combine them into a more powerful query. 

After you've completed your rules, click the 'Save' button.
