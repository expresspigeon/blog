After you entered all information, click 'Create new list button'. Now you have Contacts list

Every Contacts List has **General** and **Physical address** properties.

#### General properties are:

* **List Name** - Internal name of your list. It is not exposed to your subscribers. 
* **From** - Name of sender (your or your organization). Subscribers will see emails as coming from this name.
* **Reply To** - Email to reply to. Subscribers will be sending email to this address if they click 'reply to' button.

#### Physical Address properties are:

* **Name** - Your name our name of your organization. It will be attached to the footer of your messages.
* **Address Line 1** - First line of your physical address. It will be attached to the footer of your messages.
* **Address Line 2** - Second line of your physical address. It can be blank. It will be attached to the footer of your messages.
*  **City** - Your city. It will be attached to the footer of your messages.
*  **State** - Your state or province. It will be attached to the footer of your messages.
*  **Zip** - Your zip or postal code. It will be attached to the footer of your messages.
*  **Country** - Your country. It will be attached to the footer of your messages.


These values from **General** tab along with **Physical address** values will be used each time you send to this specific list. This means if you will send to different lists you can have different values in general and physical address fields.

Note please that values for both properties are defaulted to your account data, but you still can update them if needed.

### Search for contacts or lists 

In case you will have many contacts lists and contacts themselves, we provide 'Search' feature that can be found on 'Contacts' list. Click 'loop' icon:

Now you can select rather you want/need to search for a Contact or for a List:

If you will look for a particular contacts list, you will be searching by list name. And if you will look for a particular contact, you will be searching by email address within all existing lists. But sometimes it's needed to find contact only within one particular Contacts list, to do this just open needed Contacts list and perform search there by email.
