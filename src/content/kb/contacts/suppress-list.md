# Suppress List

Each account has a Suppress List which contains the following categories of contacts:

## Suppressed Categories
 
Your Suppress List may contain the following categories of contacts: 
 
* Bounced - undeliverable email addresses
* Unsubscribed  - unsubscribed contacts
* SPAM - contacts that reported your message as SPAM (we have FBL integrations with all major ISPs )
* Uploaded - those directly uploaded into a Suppressed list by you (when new customers migrate to us from other ESPs)

> We strongly recommend uploading your current suppressed contacts into your Suppressed List during migration to our system
in order to avoid re-sending of unwanted messages. 

## Removing Contacts from Supress List

As an account holder you have the power to move contacts freely across all lists except a Suppress List. 
If a contact has a desire to be moved from a Suppress List back to an active list, they will have to subscribe again 
 using one of the [Web forms](/kb/regular-web-forms) you define. 


## Manually unsubscribing contacts

An account owner can manually unsubscribe a contact by navigating to that contacts profile page and pressing the "Unsubscribe" button:

## Unsuppressing contacts

Removing contacts from the Suppress List can be done by a contact subscribing again with a [Subscription form](regular-web-forms). 

In some cases when you feel strongly that a suppressed contact should not have been suppressed, send us a [support ticket](/support) 
and we may move the contact back to an appropriate list.

> Why can't you just move contacts from a suppress list to any active list? Because we respect every individual's decition to subscribe 
to whatever source of information they want. It also makes it easier to be compliant with [CAN SPAM Act](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business).
