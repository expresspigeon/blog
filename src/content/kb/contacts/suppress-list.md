## Suppressed categories
 
Your Suppress List may contain the following categories of contacts: 
 
* Bounced - undeliverable email addresses
* Unsubscribed  - unsubscribed contacts
* SPAM - contacts that reported your message as SPAM (we have FBL integrations with all major ISPs )
* Uploaded - those directly uploaded into a Suppressed list by you (when new customers migrate to us from other ESPs)

> We strongly recommend uploading your current suppressed contacts into your Suppressed List during migration to our system
in order to avoid re-sending of unwanted messages. 

## Removing Contacts from Supress List

As an account holder you have the power to move contacts freely across all lists except a Suppress List. 
If a contact has a desire to be moved from a Suppress List back to an active list, they will have to subscribe again 
 using one of the [Web forms](/kb/regular-web-forms) you define.
