ExpressPigeon provides three different ways of adding contacts to the list:

* Upload CSV file
* Type manually
* Spreadsheet copy/paste

### Upload CSV file

Upload your contacts as a comma separated files (csv). We provide an example of CSV file that you can download and use:

When you open downloaded file you will see following:

Please follow 3 basic rules:

* A header may be in upper or lower case and may contain any number of ′−′ or ′ _ ′ or spaces. So, for instance, you can use header 'First Name' or 'First_Name', our system will handle this.
* Invalid headers are ignored.
* If your CSV does not have headers, we will expect it to have a single column with emails only.

After you have prepared CSV file with contacts, just drag'n'drop it or use 'Browse' button to upload it manually. After our system process this file, you will get notification to your email with all details about processes contacts.

### Type manually

Here you can simply manually type such details as 'Email', 'First Name' and 'Last name'.
