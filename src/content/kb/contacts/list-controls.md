# List Controls

You can perform several different actions on contacts within the list. 

In order to enable them, you have to _select at least one contact inside the list_ using checkboxes:

## Move contacts

Moving is the same as copying described above with one difference - selected contact(s) will be moved to the target list.
 This means that they will be removed from the current list. 

## Delete contacts

This operation allows you to delete selected contact(s) from the current list. 
Note that the contacts will not be removed from other lists. 

## Delete contacts from all lists

Deleting from "All list" is the same as completely deleting from your account. 

## Download contacts as CSV

You can download a CSV file with selected contact(s). To do this, please select contacts and click the 
'Download CSV' button on control panel.
