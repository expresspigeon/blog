# Contact Lists

## Creating a Contact List

Before you can send your first Campaign, you will need to create a 
Contact List. In order to do this, please click the 'Contacts' option at the top menu and then 
click the 'Create New List' button. You will see the following:

The following options are available on this page:

* **List Name** - Internal name of your list. It is not exposed to your subscribers. 
* **From** - Name of sender (you or your organization). Subscribers will see messages as coming from this name.
* **Reply To** - Email to reply to. Subscribers will be replying back to this address if they click 'reply to' button.

After you entered all information, click the 'Create new list' button. 

## Opening List Properties

You can open the 'Contact List Properties' page in two ways. 

The first and easiest option is simply to click the 'Properties' button for a specific list on the 'Contacts' page:

## Setting List Properties

Every Contacts List has **General** and **Physical address** properties.

### General properties

* **List Name** - Internal name of your list. It is not exposed to your subscribers. 
* **From** - Name of sender (your or your organization). Subscribers will see emails as coming from this name.
* **Reply To** - Email to reply to. Subscribers will be sending email to this address if they click 'reply to' button.

### Physical Address properties

* **Name** - Your name or the name of your organization. 
* **Address Line 1** - First line of your physical address. 
* **Address Line 2** - Second line of your physical address. 
*  **City** - Your city. 
*  **State** - Your state or province. 
*  **Zip** - Your zip or postal code. 
*  **Country** - Your country. 


> The Physical address properties will be automatically attached to the bottom of your newsletters. 
>It is a requirement by [CAN SPAM Act](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). 

The values from the **General** tab along with the **Physical address** will be used each time you send to a 
specific list. It also means that you can have different physical addresses used in different lists.
An agency that manages multiple lists on behalf of their customers usually use this feature. 

> Please, note that list properties are defaulted to your account, unless you update them.
