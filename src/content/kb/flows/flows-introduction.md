# Flows introduction


Marketing Automation is the process of putting your actions and decisions on autopilot. 
Frequently, marketers have to send targeted emails as well as perform other actions such as segmenting, tagging, etc. 

ExpressPigeon Automation makes these tasks easy, allowing marketers to save time and 
money by doing the grunt work in the background. 

ExpressPigeon Automation allows you to prioritize and execute your marketing tasks 
in a more efficient manner by creating "Flows" that give each individual customer 
their own experience based on their interactions. 

Automation takes traditional marketing email campaigns to the next level. 
If used correctly, you can send customized content and messaging to your 
lead segments and ultimately create more personalized experiences for your 
subscribers. This approach will help you to increase your ROI, and make your 
customers feel a more personal connection to you while _reducing your effort_.
