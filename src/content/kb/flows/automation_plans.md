## Contacts Overage

If your contacts number changes, our system will automatically downgrade or upgrade your automation plan. You will get email notifications about such changes.

**Example**:
    - If you have 170,000 contacts and your current automation plan cost is $239.99. 
    - Your contacts number changes to 350,000 contacts
    - Our system will automatically upgrade your plan to $479.99 and charge the prorated difference.
    - If  your contacts number drops to 50,000, our system will automatically downgrade plan from $479.99 to $95.99, while keeping remaining balance on your account.


## Failure to renew

In the event your credit card expired or we are unable to process a scheduled payment, our system will send you an email notification and will display a  message on the dashboard in your account. Our system will try to renew your plan for 3 consecutive days (once per day) and, in case of a failure, your automation plan will be canceled and all flows will stop operating.

## Plan cancellation

You can cancel at any time. [Terms of Service](/terms) for automation subscription cancellations are the same as for marketing and transactional ones.
