# Flows Dry Run


A Dry Run mode allows to visualize a path through a flow based on all conditions for a specific contact. 
All conditions will make decisions according to this contact’s data. The Flow will paint the path of 
execution by highlighting the arrows connecting conditions and actions in <span style="color:red">red color</span>. 

> No action will be executed in the Dry Run Mode. 

Use Dry Run to simply ensure that you put the right conditions in place.
