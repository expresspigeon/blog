## Plans overview

When  you navigate to My Account -> Plans you will see a page with three expandable sections, 
one for each type of a plan. Even before expanding, you can see the details of each plan you

## Marketing Plan

If  you need to upgrade or downgrade your Marketing plan, open up the  "Marketing Plan" section, 
make a selection that fits your needs best and follow the prompts. 

If you upgrade to a more expensive plan, your current balance will be prorated, so you will not be 
charged an entire amount. If you are  down-grading to a less expensive plan, your current balance will carry forward.
If you are downgrading to a Free plan, your remaining balance will be forfeited.
