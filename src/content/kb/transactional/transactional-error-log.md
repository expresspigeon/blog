# Webhooks Error Log

In case there are problems sending webhooks to your API, the errors will be logged and accessible on this page.

We retain at most 500 errors, at which point, we disable the webhooks for all events and send you a notification by email.
 
> If your site went down and you have data gaps, you can fill them up by using our [Transactional API](transactional-reporting-for-multiple-messages).
