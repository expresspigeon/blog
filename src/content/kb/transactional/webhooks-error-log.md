# Webhooks Error Log

In case there are problems sending webhooks to your API, the errors will be logged and accessible on the 'Errors Log' page.

You can access it by clicking menu at the top left corner and selecting 'ERROR LOG'.

We retain at most 500 errors, at which point, we disable the webhooks for all events and send you a notification by email.
 
> If your site went down and you have data gaps, you can fill them up by using our [Transactional API](transactional-reporting-for-multiple-messages).

For data related to [Webhook actions](/kb/flows-actions) that ran into issues with your API,  we do not preserve such data. However, you 
can send us a [request](/support) and we will consider running a custom query to back-fill your lost data.
