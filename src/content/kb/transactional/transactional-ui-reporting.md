# Transactional Reporting

We provide a full dashboard for reporting and tracking transactional messages.
 You can find it on the menu, or by directly accessing [Transactional messages](https://expresspigeon.com/messages).

# History of a Single Message

You can find out the entire history of a transactional message when you expand it from the Opens/Clicks column.
