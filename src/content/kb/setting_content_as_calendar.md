# Setting the Content as Calendar Countdown

Selecting Calendar as the content type will open the _Insert calendar countdown_ window. From here you can set from multiple coundown
types on the left and set your target date/time on the right by using the calendar and the clock icon. Clicking the _Create_ button will then insert your chosen countdown into the 
selected block. You will not see the countown in the editor, but it will be accurate to anyone who receives your message and remain 
accurate regardless of how many times they open it.
