# Campaign Wizard

Campaign Wizard is an optional feature for customers who want to have a [Campaign Approval](/kb/campaigns-approval) feature to be turned on their accounts. 

If this feature is enabled on your account (contact [Support](/support) to get it enabled), you 
will be configuring a new campaign in a step-by-step fashion. 
It makes it easier for users to focus on one thing at the time and helps avoid costly mistakes.  


## Step 1

This helps you configure a campaign name, subject and a second subject if you chose to use A/B split campaigns.
Once done, just click the "Next &rarr;" button to move to the next page.

Below is an example of  the same page as above but with expanded A/B section and a second subject.

## Step 2

Setup Target audience, as well as to and from values. The Target audience allows you a powerful feature of 
selecting any combination of lists and their respective [segments](segments). 

> Our system automatically de-dupes contacts for campaigns. Even if the same contact is present on multiple lists and segments,
that person will receive a single message.

## Step 3

In case you want to use the [Automation Flow](/kb#automation) feature, you can hookup a new flow and event trigger to your campaign. 

For instance, you can trigger a flow fr a contact after you send a campaign and that contact clicks a specific link. This is a
very powerful feature, the one you can use to build custom nurturing and cross-marketing processes.

## Step 5 - Final Review

The Final Review helps you have a single view of all parameters of a campaign before you send it out. In case you want
to adjust any properties, you can always click  the "&larr; Previous" button.
