# Campaigns Approval

Campaign Approval process allows companies to separate responsibilities 
between individuals who  prepare campaigns and those who approve the content and other sending 
options and ultimately allow campaigns to be sent. 

The Campaign Approval process works together with the [Campaign Wizard](/kb/campaign-wizard). 


The Campaign Approval and the [Campaign Wizard](/kb/campaign-wizard) are not 
enabled by default.


> Please, contact us on the [Support](/support) page to request the 
Campaign Approval on  your account.


## Campaign Approval Indicator   

Whenever a campaign is completed with  the [Campaign Wizard](/kb/campaign-wizard)
and is waiting for approval, the "Waiting for Approval" button on the "All Campaigns" displays an orange counter indicator. 

When the "Waiting for Approval" button is pressed, the system will display a list of campaigns waiting for approval.
